Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: dice: fix wrong packet parameter for Alesis iO26
Git-commit: 3a9236e97207f2469254b4098995159b80174d95
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16518

At higher sampling rate (e.g. 192.0 kHz), Alesis iO26 transfers 4 data
channels per data block in CIP.

Both iO14 and iO26 have the same contents in their configuration ROM.
For this reason, ALSA Dice driver attempts to distinguish them according
to the value of TX0_AUDIO register at probe callback. Although the way is
valid at lower and middle sampling rate, it's lastly invalid at higher
sampling rate because because the two models returns the same value for
read transaction to the register.

In the most cases, users just plug-in the device and ALSA dice driver
detects it. In the case, the device runs at lower sampling rate and
the driver detects expectedly. For this reason, this commit leaves the
way to detect as is.
