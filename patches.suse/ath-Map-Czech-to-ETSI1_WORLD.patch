Subject: [PATCH] ath: Map Czech to ETSI1_WORLD
Git-commit: 0fa31a86998b558ce7ef21ef84bde175d9aba11d
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: FATE#326906

The regdomain code is used to select the correct the correct conformance
test limits (CTL) for a country. If the regdomain code isn't correctly
mapped to the actual CTL entries in EEPROM then it could happen that the
device violates the regulations. But it can also happen that the device is
then not able to be used with its full txpower on all rates.

This change itself doesn't change the selected CTL of this country and is
only required to stay in sync with the QCA mappings.
