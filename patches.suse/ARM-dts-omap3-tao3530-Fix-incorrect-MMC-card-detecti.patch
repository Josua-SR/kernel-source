Subject: ARM: dts: omap3-tao3530: Fix incorrect MMC card detection GPIO
 polarity
Git-commit: 287897f9aaa2ad1c923d9875914f57c4dc9159c8
Patch-mainline: 5.5-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.17

The MMC card detection GPIO polarity is active low on TAO3530, like in many
other similar boards. Now the card is not detected and it is unable to
mount rootfs from an SD card.

Fix this by using the correct polarity.

This incorrect polarity was defined already in the commit 30d95c6d7092
("ARM: dts: omap3: Add Technexion TAO3530 SOM omap3-tao3530.dtsi") in v3.18
kernel and later changed to use defined GPIO constants in v4.4 kernel by
the commit 3a637e008e54 ("ARM: dts: Use defined GPIO constants in flags
cell for OMAP2+ boards").

While the latter commit did not introduce the issue I'm marking it with
Fixes tag due the v4.4 kernels still being maintained.
