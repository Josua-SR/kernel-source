Subject: rbd: don't test rbd_dev->opts in rbd_dev_image_release()
Git-commit: b8776051529230f76e464d5ffc5d1cf8465576bf
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc2
References: bsc#1171392

rbd_dev->opts is used to distinguish between the image that is being
mapped and a parent.  However, because we no longer establish watch for
read-only mappings, this test is imprecise and results in unnecessary
rbd_unregister_watch() calls.

Make it consistent with need_watch in rbd_dev_image_probe().
