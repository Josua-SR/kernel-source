Subject: [PATCH] media: cx23885: add more quirks for reset DMA on some AMD IOMMU
Git-commit: dbf0b3a7b719eb3f72cb53c2ce7d34a012a9c261
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

On AMD Family 15h (Models 30h-3fh), I/O Memory Management Unit
RiSC engine sometimes stalls, requiring a reset.

As result, MythTV and w-scan won't scan channels on the AMD Kaveri
APU with the Hauppauge QuadHD TV tuner card.

For the solution I added the Input/Output Memory Management Unit's PCI
Identity of 0x1423 to the broken_dev_id[] array, which is used by
a quirks logic meant to fix similar problems with other AMD
chipsets.
