Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ath10k: fix DMA related firmware crashes on multiple devices"
Git-commit: a1769bb68a850508a492e3674ab1e5e479b11254
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 76d164f582150fd0259ec0fcbc485470bcd8033e.
PCIe hung issue was observed on multiple platforms. The issue was reproduced
when DUT was configured as AP and associated with 50+ STAs.

For QCA9984/QCA9888, the DMA_BURST_SIZE register controls the AXI burst size
of the RD/WR access to the HOST MEM.
0 - No split , RAW read/write transfer size from MAC is put out on bus
    as burst length
1 - Split at 256 byte boundary
2,3 - Reserved

With PCIe protocol analyzer, we can see DMA Read crossing 4KB boundary when
issue happened. It broke PCIe spec and caused PCIe stuck. So revert
the default value from 0 to 1.

Tested: IPQ8064 + QCA9984 with firmware 10.4-3.10-00047         QCS404 + QCA9984 with firmware 10.4-3.9.0.2--00044         Synaptics AS370 + QCA9888  with firmware 10.4-3.9.0.2--00040
