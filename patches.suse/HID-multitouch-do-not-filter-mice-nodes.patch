Subject: [PATCH] HID: multitouch: do not filter mice nodes
Git-commit: c23e2043d5f7177c3f40da70663b2f3a1de82f5c
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

It was a good idea at the time to not create a mouse node for the
multitouch touchscreens, but:
- touchscreens following the Win 8 protocol should not have this
  disturbing mouse node anymore, or if they have, it should be
  used for something else (like a joystick attached to the screen)
- touchpads have it, and they should not use it unless there is a bug,
  but when the laptop has a trackstick, the data are reported through this
  mouse node.

So instead of whitelisting all of the devices that have a need for the
mouse node, just export it.
hid-input.c will append a suffix to it ('Mouse'), so users will eventually
see if something goes wrong.
