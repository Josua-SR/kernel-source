Subject: selftests/seccomp: fix build on older kernels

Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.6

The seccomp selftest goes to some length to build against older kernel
headers, viz. all the #ifdefs at the beginning of the file.

Commit 201766a20e30 ("ptrace: add PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO request")
introduces some additional macros, but doesn't do the #ifdef dance.
Let's add that dance here to avoid:

gcc -Wl,-no-as-needed -Wall  seccomp_bpf.c -lpthread -o seccomp_bpf
