Subject: samples/bpf: Use own flags but not HOSTCFLAGS
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: 10cb3d8706dbaa0521e761b96b3be5b7a497ae3f
References: bsc#1177028

While compiling natively, the host's cflags and ldflags are equal to
ones used from HOSTCFLAGS and HOSTLDFLAGS. When cross compiling it
should have own, used for target arch. While verification, for arm,
arm64 and x86_64 the following flags were used always:

-Wall -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer
-Wmissing-prototypes
-Wstrict-prototypes

So, add them as they were verified and used before adding
Makefile.target and lets omit "-fomit-frame-pointer" as were proposed
while review, as no sense in such optimization for samples.
