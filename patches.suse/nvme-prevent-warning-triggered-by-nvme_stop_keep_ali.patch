Subject: [PATCH] nvme: prevent warning triggered by nvme_stop_keep_alive
Git-commit: 97b2512ad000a409b4073dd1a71e4157d76675cb
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc2
References: bsc#1169045

Delayed keep alive work is queued on system workqueue and may be cancelled
via nvme_stop_keep_alive from nvme_reset_wq, nvme_fc_wq or nvme_wq.

Check_flush_dependency detects mismatched attributes between the work-queue
context used to cancel the keep alive work and system-wq. Specifically
system-wq does not have the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag, whereas the contexts used
to cancel keep alive work have WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag.

Example warning:

  workqueue: WQ_MEM_RECLAIM nvme-reset-wq:nvme_fc_reset_ctrl_work [nvme_fc]
	is flushing !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM events:nvme_keep_alive_work [nvme_core]

To avoid the flags mismatch, delayed keep alive work is queued on nvme_wq.

However this creates a secondary concern where work and a request to cancel
that work may be in the same work queue - namely err_work in the rdma and
tcp transports, which will want to flush/cancel the keep alive work which
will now be on nvme_wq.

After reviewing the transports, it looks like err_work can be moved to
nvme_reset_wq. In fact that aligns them better with transition into
RESETTING and performing related reset work in nvme_reset_wq.

Change nvme-rdma and nvme-tcp to perform err_work in nvme_reset_wq.
