Subject: idr: Fix idr_alloc_u32 on 32-bit systems
Git-commit: b7e9728f3d7fc5c5c8508d99f1675212af5cfd49
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc7
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.15

Attempting to allocate an entry at 0xffffffff when one is already
present would succeed in allocating one at 2^32, which would confuse
everything.  Return -ENOSPC in this case, as expected.
