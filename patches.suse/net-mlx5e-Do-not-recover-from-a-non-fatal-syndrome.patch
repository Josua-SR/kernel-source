Subject: net/mlx5e: Do not recover from a non-fatal syndrome
Patch-mainline: v5.6
Git-commit: 187a9830c921d92c4a9a8e2921ecc4b35a97532c
References: jsc#SLE-8464

For non-fatal syndromes like LOCAL_LENGTH_ERR, recovery shouldn't be
triggered. In these scenarios, the RQ is not actually in ERR state.
This misleads the recovery flow which assumes that the RQ is really in
error state and no more completions arrive, causing crashes on bad page
state.

Fixes: 8276ea1353a4 ("net/mlx5e: Report and recover from CQE with error on RQ")
