Subject: crypto: inside-secure - align the cipher and hash send functions

Git-commit: 152bdf4cdb9c20e1858bc1b754c7bfb984a6ea14
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: fate#326470

The cipher and hash send functions both set the results variable, to be
used later by the caller. Align the way they're setting this variable.
