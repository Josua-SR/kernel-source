Subject: i40e: stop using cmpxchg flow in i40e_set_priv_flags()
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc1
Git-commit: 886ff146a73627c287262a7d92ddfb50baa29552
References: bsc#1101816 FATE#325147 FATE#325149

Now that the only places which modify flags are either (a) during
initialization prior to creating a netdevice, or (b) while holding the
rtnl lock, we no longer need the cmpxchg64 call in i40e_set_priv_flags.
