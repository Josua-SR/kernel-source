Subject: udp: fix integer overflow while computing available space in
 sk_rcvbuf
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc5
Git-commit: feed8a4fc9d46c3126fb9fcae0e9248270c6321a
References: bsc#1154353

When the size of the receive buffer for a socket is close to 2^31 when
computing if we have enough space in the buffer to copy a packet from
the queue to the buffer we might hit an integer overflow.

When an user set net.core.rmem_default to a value close to 2^31 UDP
packets are dropped because of this overflow. This can be visible, for
instance, with failure to resolve hostnames.

This can be fixed by casting sk_rcvbuf (which is an int) to unsigned
int, similarly to how it is done in TCP.
