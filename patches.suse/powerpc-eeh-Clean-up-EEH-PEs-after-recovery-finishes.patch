Subject: powerpc/eeh: Clean up EEH PEs after recovery finishes
Git-commit: 799abe283e5103d48e079149579b4f167c95ea0e
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.5

When the last device in an eeh_pe is removed the eeh_pe structure itself
(and any empty parents) are freed since they are no longer needed. This
results in a crash when a hotplug driver is involved since the following
may occur:

1. Device is suprise removed.
2. Driver performs an MMIO, which fails and queues and eeh_event.
3. Hotplug driver receives a hotplug interrupt and removes any
   pci_devs that were under the slot.
4. pci_dev is torn down and the eeh_pe is freed.
5. The EEH event handler thread processes the eeh_event and crashes
   since the eeh_pe pointer in the eeh_event structure is no
   longer valid.

Crashing is generally considered poor form. Instead of doing that use
the fact PEs are marked as EEH_PE_INVALID to keep them around until the
end of the recovery cycle, at which point we can safely prune any empty
PEs.
