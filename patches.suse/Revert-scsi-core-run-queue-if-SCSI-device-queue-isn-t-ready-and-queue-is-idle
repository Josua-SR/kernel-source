Subject: Revert "scsi: core: run queue if SCSI device queue isn't ready and
 queue is idle"
Git-commit: b4fd63f42647110c963d4bfcd526ac48f5a5faff
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1186949

This reverts commit 7e70aa789d4a0c89dbfbd2c8a974a4df717475ec.

Now that we have the patches ("blk-mq: In blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list()
"no budget" is a reason to kick") and ("blk-mq: Rerun dispatching in
the case of budget contention") we should no longer need the fix in
the SCSI code.  Revert it, resolving conflicts with other patches that
have touched this code.

With this revert (and the two new patches) I can run the script that
was in commit 7e70aa789d4a ("scsi: core: run queue if SCSI device
queue isn't ready and queue is idle") in a loop with no failure.  If I
do this revert without the two new patches I can easily get a failure.
