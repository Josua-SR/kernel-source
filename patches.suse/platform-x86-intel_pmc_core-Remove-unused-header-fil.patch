Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Remove unused header file
Git-commit: 941691ef2197944a202d7870dcd7da3fb0391c65
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: FATE#326281

Recently sent patch 'platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Remove unused EXPORTED
API' missed to remove the header file 'arch/x86/include/asm/pmc_core.h'
which was solely used to declare the EXPORTED API
'intel_pmc_slp_s0_counter_read'. This patch provides the errata fix for the
same.
