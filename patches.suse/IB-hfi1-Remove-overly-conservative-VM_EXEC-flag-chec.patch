Subject: IB/hfi1: Remove overly conservative VM_EXEC flag check
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc5
Git-commit: 7709b0dc265f28695487712c45f02bbd1f98415d
References: jsc#SLE-4925

Applications that use the stack for execution purposes cause userspace PSM
jobs to fail during mmap().

Both Fortran (non-standard format parsing) and C (callback functions
located in the stack) applications can be written such that stack
execution is required. The linker notes this via the gnu_stack ELF flag.

This causes READ_IMPLIES_EXEC to be set which forces all PROT_READ mmaps
to have PROT_EXEC for the process.

Checking for VM_EXEC bit and failing the request with EPERM is overly
conservative and will break any PSM application using executable stacks.
