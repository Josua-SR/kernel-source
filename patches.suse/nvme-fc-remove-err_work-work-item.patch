Subject: [PATCH] nvme-fc: remove err_work work item
Git-commit: 9c2bb2577d81b1a09f7e342e947986e55cad18e3
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc2
References: bsc#1177326

err_work was created to handle errors (mainly I/O timeouts) while in
CONNECTING state. The flag for err_work_active is also unneeded.

Remove err_work_active and err_work.  The actions to abort I/Os are moved
inline to nvme_error_recovery().
