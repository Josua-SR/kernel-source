Subject: x86/boot/compressed/64: Sanity-check CPUID results in the early #VC
 handler
Git-commit: ed7b895f3efb5df184722f5a30f8164fcaffceb1
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc3
References: jsc#SLE-14337

The early #VC handler which doesn't have a GHCB can only handle CPUID
exit codes. It is needed by the early boot code to handle #VC exceptions
raised in verify_cpu() and to get the position of the C-bit.

But the CPUID information comes from the hypervisor which is untrusted
and might return results which trick the guest into the no-SEV boot path
with no C-bit set in the page-tables. All data written to memory would
then be unencrypted and could leak sensitive data to the hypervisor.

Add sanity checks to the early #VC handler to make sure the hypervisor
can not pretend that SEV is disabled.
