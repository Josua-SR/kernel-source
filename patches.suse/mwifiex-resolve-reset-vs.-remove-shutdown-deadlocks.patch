Subject: [PATCH] mwifiex: resolve reset vs. remove()/shutdown() deadlocks
Git-commit: a64e7a79dd6030479caad603c8d78e6c9c14904f
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: FATE#326294

Commit b014e96d1abb ("PCI: Protect pci_error_handlers->reset_notify()
usage with device_lock()") resolves races between driver reset and
removal, but it introduces some new deadlock problems. If we see a
timeout while we've already started suspending, removing, or shutting
down the driver, we might see:

(a) a worker thread, running mwifiex_pcie_work() ->
    mwifiex_pcie_card_reset_work() -> pci_reset_function()
(b) a removal thread, running mwifiex_pcie_remove() ->
    mwifiex_free_adapter() -> mwifiex_unregister() ->
    mwifiex_cleanup_pcie() -> cancel_work_sync(&card->work)

Unfortunately, mwifiex_pcie_remove() already holds the device lock that
pci_reset_function() is now requesting, and so we see a deadlock.

It's necessary to cancel and synchronize our outstanding work before
tearing down the driver, so we can't have this work wait indefinitely
for the lock.

It's reasonable to only "try" to reset here, since this will mostly
happen for cases where it's already difficult to reset the firmware
anyway (e.g., while we're suspending or powering off the system). And if
reset *really* needs to happen, we can always try again later.
