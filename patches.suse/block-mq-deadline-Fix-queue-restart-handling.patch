Subject: block: mq-deadline: Fix queue restart handling
Git-commit: cb8acabbe33b110157955a7425ee876fb81e6bbc
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

Commit 7211aef86f79 ("block: mq-deadline: Fix write completion
handling") added a call to blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx() in
dd_dispatch_request() to make sure that write request dispatching does
not stall when all target zones are locked. This fix left a subtle race
when a write completion happens during a dispatch execution on another
CPU:

CPU 0: Dispatch			CPU1: write completion

dd_dispatch_request()
    lock(&dd->lock);
    ...
    lock(&dd->zone_lock);	dd_finish_request()
    rq = find request		lock(&dd->zone_lock);
    unlock(&dd->zone_lock);
    				zone write unlock
				unlock(&dd->zone_lock);
				...
				__blk_mq_free_request
                                      check restart flag (not set)
				      -> queue not run
    ...
    if (!rq && have writes)
        blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx()
    unlock(&dd->lock)

Since the dispatch context finishes after the write request completion
handling, marking the queue as needing a restart is not seen from
__blk_mq_free_request() and blk_mq_sched_restart() not executed leading
to the dispatch stall under 100% write workloads.

Fix this by moving the call to blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx() from
dd_dispatch_request() into dd_finish_request() under the zone lock to
ensure full mutual exclusion between write request dispatch selection
and zone unlock on write request completion.
