Subject: [PATCH] staging: rtl8192u: remove GPL boiler plate text
Git-commit: 056535320bc2d4d2d246df6369ff3d37a72f0148
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-13430

The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which
can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.

The file ieee80211_module.c has a proper SPDX line, so the
GPL boiler plate text is not needed.
