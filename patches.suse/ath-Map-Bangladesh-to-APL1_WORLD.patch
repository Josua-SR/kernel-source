Subject: [PATCH] ath: Map Bangladesh to APL1_WORLD
Git-commit: 1507b32891c0f1b5041a61d3c41e93d54602f76d
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: FATE#326906

The regdomain code is used to select the correct the correct conformance
test limits (CTL) for a country. If the regdomain code isn't correctly
mapped to the actual CTL entries in EEPROM then it could happen that the
device violates the regulations. But it can also happen that the device is
then not able to be used with its full txpower on all rates.

The CTL mappings for this regdomain code were now changed to:

* 2.4GHz: ETSI
* 5GHz: NO_CTL -> FCC
