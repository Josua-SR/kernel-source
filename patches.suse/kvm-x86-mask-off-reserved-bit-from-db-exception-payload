Subject: KVM: x86: Mask off reserved bit from #DB exception payload
Git-commit: 307f1cfa269657c63cfe2c932386fcc24684d9dd
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc2
References: bsc#1164353

KVM defines the #DB payload as compatible with the 'pending debug
exceptions' field under VMX, not DR6. Mask off bit 12 when applying the
payload to DR6, as it is reserved on DR6 but not the 'pending debug
exceptions' field.

Fixes: f10c729ff965 ("kvm: vmx: Defer setting of DR6 until #DB delivery")
