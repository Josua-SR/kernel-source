Subject: drm: writeback: Fix doc that says connector should be disconnected
Git-commit: 71a5cb3eb758b5b3735709c7fca577522eda43d4
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

During iteration process one of the proposed mechanism for not
breaking existing userspace was to report writeback connectors as
disconnected, however the final version used
DRM_CLIENT_CAP_WRITEBACK_CONNECTORS for that purpose.

- * * Writeback connectors should always report as "disconnected" (so that
- *   clients which don't understand them will ignore them).
+ * * Writeback connectors are visible to userspace only when the client sets

  *
  * * Writeback connectors don't have EDID.
