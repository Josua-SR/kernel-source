Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: fix RockPro64 sdmmc settings
Git-commit: 5234c14531152702a9f3e575cb552b7e9cea9f94
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc5
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.10

According to the RockPro64 schematic [1] the rk3399 sdmmc controller is
connected to a microSD (TF card) slot. Remove the cap-mmc-highspeed
property of the sdmmc controller, since no mmc card can be connected here.
