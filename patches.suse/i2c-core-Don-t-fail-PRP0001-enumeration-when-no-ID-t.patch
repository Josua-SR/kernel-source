Subject: [PATCH] i2c: core: Don't fail PRP0001 enumeration when no ID table exist

When commit c64ffff7a9d1 ("i2c: core: Allow empty id_table in ACPI case
as well") fixed the enumeration of IÂ²C devices on ACPI enabled platforms
when driver has no ID table, it missed the PRP0001 support.

i2c_device_match() and i2c_acpi_match_device() differently match
driver against given device. Use acpi_driver_match_device(), that is used
in the former, in i2c_device_probe() and don't fail PRP0001 enumeration
when no ID table exist.
