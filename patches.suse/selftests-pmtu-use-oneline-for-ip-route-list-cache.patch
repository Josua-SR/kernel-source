Subject: selftests: pmtu: use -oneline for ip route list cache
Git-commit: 2745aea6750ff0d2c48285d25bdb00e5b636ec8b
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.15

Some versions of iproute2 will output more than one line per entry, which
will cause the test to fail, like:

TEST: ipv6: list and flush cached exceptions                        [FAIL]
  can't list cached exceptions

That happens, for example, with iproute2 4.15.0. When using the -oneline
option, this will work just fine:

TEST: ipv6: list and flush cached exceptions                        [ OK ]

This also works just fine with a more recent version of iproute2, like
5.4.0.

For some reason, two lines are printed for the IPv4 test no matter what
version of iproute2 is used. Use the same -oneline parameter there instead
of counting the lines twice.
