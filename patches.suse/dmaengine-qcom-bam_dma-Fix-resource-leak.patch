Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: Fix resource leak
Git-commit: 7667819385457b4aeb5fac94f67f52ab52cc10d5
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc6
References: git-fixes bnc#1151927 5.3.9

bam_dma_terminate_all() will leak resources if any of the transactions are
committed to the hardware (present in the desc fifo), and not complete.
Since bam_dma_terminate_all() does not cause the hardware to be updated,
the hardware will still operate on any previously committed transactions.
This can cause memory corruption if the memory for the transaction has been
reassigned, and will cause a sync issue between the BAM and its client(s).

Fix this by properly updating the hardware in bam_dma_terminate_all().
