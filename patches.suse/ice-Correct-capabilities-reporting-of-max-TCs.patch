Subject: ice: Correct capabilities reporting of max TCs
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: 9164f761c99493a947dcbf3889a157943b46e738
References: jsc#SLE-7926

Firmware always returns 8 as the max number of supported TCs. However on
devices with more than 4 ports, the maximum number of TCs per port is
limited to 4. Check and, if necessary, correct the reporting of
capabilities for devices with more than 4 ports.
