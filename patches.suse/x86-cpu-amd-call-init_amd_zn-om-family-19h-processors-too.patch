Subject: x86/cpu/amd: Call init_amd_zn() om Family 19h processors too
Git-commit: 753039ef8b2f1078e5bff8cd42f80578bf6385b0
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1181077

Family 19h CPUs are Zen-based and still share most architectural
features with Family 17h CPUs, and therefore still need to call
init_amd_zn() e.g., to set the RECLAIM_DISTANCE override.

init_amd_zn() also sets X86_FEATURE_ZEN, which today is only used
in amd_set_core_ssb_state(), which isn't called on some late
model Family 17h CPUs, nor on any Family 19h CPUs:
X86_FEATURE_AMD_SSBD replaces X86_FEATURE_LS_CFG_SSBD on those
later model CPUs, where the SSBD mitigation is done via the
SPEC_CTRL MSR instead of the LS_CFG MSR.

Family 19h CPUs also don't have the erratum where the CPB feature
bit isn't set, but that code can stay unchanged and run safely
on Family 19h.
