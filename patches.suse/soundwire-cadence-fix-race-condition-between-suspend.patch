Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: cadence: fix race condition between suspend and Slave device alerts
References: jsc#SLE-16518
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
Git-commit: d2068da5c85697b5880483dd7beaba98e0b62e02

In system suspend stress cases, the SOF CI reports timeouts. The root
cause is that an alert is generated while the system suspends. The
interrupt handling generates transactions on the bus that will never
be handled because the interrupts are disabled in parallel.

As a result, the transaction never completes and times out on resume.
This error doesn't seem too problematic since it happens in a work
queue, and the system recovers without issues.

Nevertheless, this race condition should not happen. When doing a
system suspend, or when disabling interrupts, we should make sure the
current transaction can complete, and prevent new work from being
queued.
