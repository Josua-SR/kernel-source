Subject: PCI: mvebu: Drop bogus comment above mvebu_pcie_map_registers()

Git-commit: f23d0d449c169d94cc958196a1d088705ef26ebc
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: fate#326470

This comment has been there since the driver was introduced, but seems
to be a leftover from previous iterations of the driver. Indeed, we do
not lookup in a list to find the register ranges that matches the
given port/lane, as the "reg" property is in each sub-node
representing a PCI port. There is no lookup involved at all.
