Subject: mmc: core: Clarify sdio_irq_pending flag for
 MMC_CAP2_SDIO_IRQ_NOTHREAD
Git-commit: 36d57efb4af534dd6b442ea0b9a04aa6dfa37abe
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

The sdio_irq_pending flag is used to let host drivers indicate that it has
signaled an IRQ. If that is the case and we only have a single SDIO func
that have claimed an SDIO IRQ, our assumption is that we can avoid reading
the SDIO_CCCR_INTx register and just call the SDIO func irq handler
immediately. This makes sense, but the flag is set/cleared in a somewhat
messy order, let's fix that up according to below.

First, the flag is currently set in sdio_run_irqs(), which is executed as a
work that was scheduled from sdio_signal_irq(). To make it more implicit
that the host have signaled an IRQ, let's instead immediately set the flag
in sdio_signal_irq(). This also makes the behavior consistent with host
drivers that uses the legacy, mmc_signal_sdio_irq() API. This have no
functional impact, because we don't expect host drivers to call
sdio_signal_irq() until after the work (sdio_run_irqs()) have been executed
anyways.

Second, currently we never clears the flag when using the sdio_run_irqs()
work, but only when using the sdio_irq_thread(). Let make the behavior
consistent, by moving the flag to be cleared inside the common
process_sdio_pending_irqs() function. Additionally, tweak the behavior of
the flag slightly, by avoiding to clear it unless we processed the SDIO
IRQ. The purpose with this at this point, is to keep the information about
whether there have been an SDIO IRQ signaled by the host, so at system
resume we can decide to process it without reading the SDIO_CCCR_INTx
register.
