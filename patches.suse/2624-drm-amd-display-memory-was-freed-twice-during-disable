Subject: drm/amd/display: Memory was freed twice during disable
Git-commit: 6e5d1c829ba6a53bdd0f18a872a5178e9620ecab
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

1. get_ss_info_from_atombios function was allocating the memory populating the provided pointer
but them freeing the memory.
Since the pointer was return as a valid value, we are trying to free the same memory during clock resource destruction
