Subject: gpu: host1x: Make host1x_cdma_wait_pushbuffer_space() static
Git-commit: 33904487f1ab1ec1f8103b1ec5dd3d26f94d9711
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152472

The host1x_cdma_wait_pushbuffer_space() function is not declared or
directly called from outside the file it is in, so make it static.

Fixes the following sparse warning:

    drivers/gpu/host1x/cdma.c:235:5: warning: symbol 'host1x_cdma_wait_pushbuffer_space' was not declared. Should it be static?
