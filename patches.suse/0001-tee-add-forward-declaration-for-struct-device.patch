Subject: tee: add forward declaration for struct device
Git-commit: 999616b8536cf3b9a1d0d74d5542ea009df482ff
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: fate#325372

tee_drv.h references struct device, but does not include device.h nor
platform_device.h. Therefore, if tee_drv.h is included by some file
that does not pull device.h nor platform_device.h beforehand, we have a
compile warning. Fix this by adding a forward declaration.
