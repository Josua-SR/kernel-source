Subject: x86/split_lock: Avoid runtime reads of the TEST_CTRL MSR
Git-commit: a6a60741035bb48ca8d9f92a138958818148064c
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12677

In a context switch from a task that is detecting split locks to one that
is not (or vice versa) we need to update the TEST_CTRL MSR. Currently this
is done with the common sequence:

        read the MSR
	flip the bit
	write the MSR
in order to avoid changing the value of any reserved bits in the MSR.

Cache unused and reserved bits of TEST_CTRL MSR with SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT bit
cleared during initialization, so we can avoid an expensive RDMSR
instruction during context switch.
