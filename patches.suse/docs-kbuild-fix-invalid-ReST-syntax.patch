Subject: [PATCH] docs: kbuild: fix invalid ReST syntax
Git-commit: 4fef9dece5785f4ca522a13600de1014943d1fba
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

I see the following warnings when I open this document with a ReST
viewer, retext:

/home/masahiro/ref/linux/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst:1142: (WARNING/2) Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
/home/masahiro/ref/linux/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst:1152: (WARNING/2) Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
/home/masahiro/ref/linux/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst:1154: (WARNING/2) Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

These hunks were added by commit e846f0dc57f4 ("kbuild: add support
for ensuring headers are self-contained") and commit 1e21cbfada87
("kbuild: support header-test-pattern-y"), respectively. They were
written not for ReST but for the plain text, and merged via the
kbuild tree.

In the same development cycle, this document was converted to ReST
by commit cd238effefa2 ("docs: kbuild: convert docs to ReST and rename
to *.rst"), and merged via the doc sub-system.

Merging them together into Linus' tree resulted in the current situation.

To fix the syntax, surround the asterisks with back-quotes, and
use :: for the code sample.

Fixes: 39ceda5ce1b0 ("Merge tag 'kbuild-v5.3' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/masahiroy/linux-kbuild")
