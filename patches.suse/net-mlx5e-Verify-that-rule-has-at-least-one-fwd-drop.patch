Subject: net/mlx5e: Verify that rule has at least one fwd/drop action
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: ae2741e2b6ce2bf1b656b1152c4ef147ff35b096
References: jsc#SLE-8464

Currently, mlx5 tc layer doesn't verify that rule has at least one forward
or drop action which leads to following firmware syndrome when user tries
to offload such action:

[ 1824.860501] mlx5_core 0000:81:00.0: mlx5_cmd_check:753:(pid 29458): SET_FLOW_TABLE_ENTRY(0x936) op_mod(0x0) failed, status bad parameter(0x3), syndrome (0x144b7a)

Add check at the end of parse_tc_fdb_actions() that verifies that resulting
attribute has action fwd or drop flag set.
