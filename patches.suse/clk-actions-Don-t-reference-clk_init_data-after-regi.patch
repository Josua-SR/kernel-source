Subject: clk: actions: Don't reference clk_init_data after registration
Git-commit: cf9ec1fc6d7cceb73e7f1efd079d2eae173fdf57
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.5

A future patch is going to change semantics of clk_register() so that
clk_hw::init is guaranteed to be NULL after a clk is registered. Avoid
referencing this member here so that we don't run into NULL pointer
exceptions.
