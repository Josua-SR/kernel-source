Subject: drm: fix typo in drm_gem_get_pages() comment
Git-commit: 5b9fbfff7644f2d3f42a6c105587b86e29ca9c48
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

I spent an embarrassingly long time looking for drm_gem_init_object()
before I realized I was actually looking for drm_gem_object_init().
Fix the typo to keep other poor developers from suffering the same
fate.
