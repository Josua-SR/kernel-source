Subject: ARM: dts: sun8i-a83t-tbs-a711: Fix WiFi resume from suspend
Git-commit: e614f341253f8541baf0230a8dc6a016b544b1e2
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc7
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.15

Without enabling keep-power-in-suspend, we can't wake the device
up using WOL packet, and the log is flooded with these messages
on resume:

sunxi-mmc 1c10000.mmc: send stop command failed
sunxi-mmc 1c10000.mmc: data error, sending stop command
sunxi-mmc 1c10000.mmc: send stop command failed
sunxi-mmc 1c10000.mmc: data error, sending stop command

So to make the WiFi really a wakeup-source, we need to keep it powered
during suspend.
