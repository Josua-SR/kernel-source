Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: pcm: Don't call sync_stop if it hasn't been stopped
Git-commit: 700cb70730777c159a988e01daa93f20a1ae9b58
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

The PCM stop operation sets the stop_operating flag for indicating the
sync_stop post-process.  This flag is, however, set unconditionally
even if the PCM trigger weren't issued.  This may lead to
inconsistency in the driver side.

Correct the code to set stop_operating flag only after the trigger
STOP is actually called.
