Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ibmvfc: Treat H_CLOSED as success during sub-CRQ
 registration

References: bsc#1182632 ltc#191222
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc3
Git-commit: 2162dc23f80770e355ef00b43573b67b80466001

A non-zero return code for H_REG_SUB_CRQ is currently treated as a failure
resulting in failing sub-CRQ setup. The case of H_CLOSED should not be
treated as a failure. This return code translates to a successful sub-CRQ
registration by the hypervisor, and is meant to communicate back that there
is currently no partner VIOS CRQ connection established as of yet. This is
a common occurrence during a disconnect where the client adapter can
possibly come back up prior to the partner adapter.

For non-zero return code from H_REG_SUB_CRQ treat a H_CLOSED as success so
that sub-CRQs are successfully setup.
