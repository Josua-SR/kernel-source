Subject: mips/atomic: Fix loongson_llsc_mb() wreckage
Git-commit: 1c6c1ca318585f1096d4d04bc722297c85e9fb8a
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.5

The comment describing the loongson_llsc_mb() reorder case doesn't
make any sense what so ever. Instruction re-ordering is not an SMP
artifact, but rather a CPU local phenomenon. Clarify the comment by
explaining that these issue cause a coherence fail.

For the branch speculation case; if futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic()
needs one at the bne branch target, then surely the normal
__cmpxch_asm() implementation does too. We cannot rely on the
barriers from cmpxchg() because cmpxchg_local() is implemented with
the same macro, and branch prediction and speculation are, too, CPU
local.
