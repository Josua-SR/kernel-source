Subject: bnxt_en: avoid string overflow for record->system_name
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
Git-commit: 3d46eee5a5f2f22ca04e2139e8c9a16b81d16073
References: bsc#1104745 FATE#325918

The utsname()->nodename string may be 64 bytes long, and it gets
copied without the trailing nul byte into the shorter record->system_name,
as gcc now warns:

In file included from include/linux/bitmap.h:9,
                 from include/linux/ethtool.h:16,
                 from drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnxt/bnxt_ethtool.c:13:
In function 'strncpy',
    inlined from 'bnxt_fill_coredump_record' at drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnxt/bnxt_ethtool.c:2863:2:
include/linux/string.h:254:9: error: '__builtin_strncpy' output truncated before terminating nul copying as many bytes from a string as its length [-Werror=stringop-truncation]

Using strlcpy() at least avoids overflowing the destination buffer
and adds proper nul-termination. It may still truncate long names
though, which probably can't be solved here.
