Subject: drm/i915: Skip barriers inside waits
Git-commit: c0e310188299358279fc27c88512f94db78991a6
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Attaching to the i915_active barrier is a two stage process, and a flush
is only effective when the barrier is activation. Thus it is possible
for us to see a barrier, and attempt to flush, only for our flush to
have no effect. As such, before attempting to activate signaling on the
fence we need to double check it is a fence!
