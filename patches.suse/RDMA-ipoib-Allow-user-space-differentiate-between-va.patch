Subject: RDMA/ipoib: Allow user space differentiate between valid dev_port
Patch-mainline: v5.2-rc1
Git-commit: b79656ed44c6865e17bcd93472ec39488bcc4984
References: bsc#1103992 FATE#326009

Systemd triggers the following warning during IPoIB device load:

 mlx5_core 0000:00:0c.0 ib0: "systemd-udevd" wants to know my dev_id.
        Should it look at dev_port instead?
        See Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-net for more info.

This is caused due to user space attempt to differentiate old systems
without dev_port and new systems with dev_port. In case dev_port will be
zero, the systemd will try to read dev_id instead.

There is no need to print a warning in such case, because it is valid
situation and it is needed to ensure systemd compatibility with old
kernels.
