Subject: ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabresd: Remove incorrect power supply assignment
Git-commit: 4521de30fbb3f5be0db58de93582ebce72c9d44f
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc7
References: bsc#1164162

The vdd3p0 LDO's input should be from external USB VBUS directly, NOT
PMIC's power supply, the vdd3p0 LDO's target output voltage can be
controlled by SW, and it requires input voltage to be high enough, with
incorrect power supply assigned, if the power supply's voltage is lower
than the LDO target output voltage, it will return fail and skip the LDO
voltage adjustment, so remove the power supply assignment for vdd3p0 to
avoid such scenario.
