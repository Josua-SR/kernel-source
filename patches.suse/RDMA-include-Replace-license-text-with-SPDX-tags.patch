Subject: RDMA/include: Replace license text with SPDX tags
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
Git-commit: 6bf9d8f6f0df3f7aa852dc111c960bc04578c7c5
References: jsc#SLE-15176

The header files in RDMA subsystem are dual licensed and can be
described by simple SPDX tag, so replace all of them at once
together with making them use the same coding style for header
guard defines.
