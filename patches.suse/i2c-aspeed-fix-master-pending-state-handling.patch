Subject: [PATCH] i2c: aspeed: fix master pending state handling
Git-commit: 1f0d9cbeec9bb0a1c2013342836f2c9754d6502b
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc5
References: git-fixes bnc#1151927 5.3.10

In case of master pending state, it should not trigger a master
command, otherwise data could be corrupted because this H/W shares
the same data buffer for slave and master operations. It also means
that H/W command queue handling is unreliable because of the buffer
sharing issue. To fix this issue, it clears command queue if a
master command is queued in pending state to use S/W solution
instead of H/W command queue handling. Also, it refines restarting
mechanism of the pending master command.
