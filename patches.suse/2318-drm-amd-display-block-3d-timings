Subject: drm/amd/display: Block 3D Timings
Git-commit: 1293b4339fb09693bdfc938495b671f0ac9bfae5
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

- we don't yet support 3D timings in DAL3
- somehow a code path was being executed that resulted in HW programming
for a 3D timing, which caused 3D displays to show half the desktop in one
frame, and the other half of the desktop in the next frame
- blocking all 3D timings in timing generator validation until we
implement proper 3D timing support
