Subject: PCI: rockchip: Move to struct pci_host_bridge IRQ mapping functions

Git-commit: 5a3dc3c1f6944b295745e9196135f3dc6508b96b
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: fate#326572

struct pci_host_bridge gained hooks to map/swizzle IRQs, so that the IRQ
mapping can be done automatically by PCI core code through the
pci_assign_irq() function instead of resorting to arch-specific
implementation callbacks to carry out the same task which force PCI host
bridge drivers implementation to implement per-arch kludges to carry out a
task that is inherently architecture agnostic.

Add map/swizzle IRQs hooks to the rockchip PCI host driver to move the IRQ
allocation into core code and stop relying on arch-specific callbacks.
