Subject: drm/i915/selftests: Skip huge pages live tests if wedged
Git-commit: 921d07d73ebf6d87064883d69fedd3d7e9e99538
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

We test the GPU handling of huge pages by submitting requests that write
into a huge page, but if the GPU is irrecoverably wedged we cannot
submit any requests. As the test expectedly fails, skip over it.
