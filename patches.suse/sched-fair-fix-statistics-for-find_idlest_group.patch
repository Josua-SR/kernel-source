Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: fix statistics for find_idlest_group()

References: bnc#1155798 (CPU scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc5
Git-commit: 289de35984815576793f579ec27248609e75976e

sgs->group_weight is not set while gathering statistics in
update_sg_wakeup_stats(). This means that a group can be classified as
fully busy with 0 running tasks if utilization is high enough.

This path is mainly used for fork and exec.

Fixes: 57abff067a08 ("sched/fair: Rework find_idlest_group()")
