Subject: net/mlx5e: Fix multipath lag activation
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc4
Git-commit: 97817fcc684ed01497bd19d0cd4dea699665b9cf
References: git-fixes

When handling FIB_EVENT_ENTRY_REPLACE event for a new multipath route,
lag activation can be missed if a stale (struct lag_mp)->mfi pointer
exists, which was associated with an older multipath route that had been
removed.

Normally, when a route is removed, it triggers mlx5_lag_fib_event(),
which handles FIB_EVENT_ENTRY_DEL and clears mfi pointer. But, if
mlx5_lag_check_prereq() condition isn't met, for example when eswitch is
in legacy mode, the fib event is skipped and mfi pointer becomes stale.

Fix by resetting mfi pointer to NULL every time mlx5_lag_mp_init() is
called.

Fixes: 544fe7c2e654 ("net/mlx5e: Activate HW multipath and handle port affinity based on FIB events")
