Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Replace RK805 PMIC node name with "pmic" on
 rk3328 boards
Git-commit: 83b994129fb4c18a8460fd395864a28740e5e7fb
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc6
References: none bsc#1175014

In some board device tree files, "rk805" was used for the RK805 PMIC's
node name. However the policy for device trees is that generic names
should be used.

Replace the "rk805" node name with the generic "pmic" name.

Fixes: 955bebde057e ("arm64: dts: rockchip: add rk3328-rock64 board")
