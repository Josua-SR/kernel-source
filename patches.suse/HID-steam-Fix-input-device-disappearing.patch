Subject: [PATCH] HID: steam: Fix input device disappearing
Git-commit: 20eee6e5af35d9586774e80b6e0b1850e7cc9899
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc6
References: git-fixes

The `connected` value for wired devices was not properly initialized,
it must be set to `true` upon creation, because wired devices do not
generate connection events.

When a raw client (the Steam Client) uses the device, the input device
is destroyed. Then, when the raw client finishes, it must be recreated.
But since the `connected` variable was false this never happended.
