Subject: drm/vc4: Unify PCM card's driver_name
Git-commit: 33c74535b03ecf11359de14bc88302595b1de44f
Patch-mainline: v5.11 or v5.11-rc5 (next release)
References: git-fixes

User-space ALSA matches a card's driver name against an internal list of
aliases in order to select the correct configuration for the system.
When the driver name isn't defined, the match is performed against the
card's name.

With the introduction of RPi4 we now have two HDMI ports with two
distinct audio cards. This is reflected in their names, making them
different from previous RPi versions. With this, ALSA ultimately misses
the board's configuration on RPi4.

In order to avoid this, set "card->driver_name" to "vc4-hdmi"
unanimously.
