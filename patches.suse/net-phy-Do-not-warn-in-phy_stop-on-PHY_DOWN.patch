Subject: net: phy: Do not warn in phy_stop() on PHY_DOWN
Git-commit: 5116a8ade333b6c2e180782139c9c516a437b21c
Patch-mainline: 5.9-rc7
References: networking-stable-20_09_24

When phy_is_started() was added to catch incorrect PHY states,
phy_stop() would not be qualified against PHY_DOWN. It is possible to
reach that state when the PHY driver has been unbound and the network
device is then brought down.
