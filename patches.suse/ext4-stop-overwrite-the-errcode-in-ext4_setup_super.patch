Subject: [PATCH] ext4: stop overwrite the errcode in ext4_setup_super
Git-commit: 5adaccac46ea79008d7b75f47913f1a00f91d0ce
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc2
References: bsc#1173841

Now the errcode from ext4_commit_super will overwrite EROFS exists in
ext4_setup_super. Actually, no need to call ext4_commit_super since we
will return EROFS. Fix it by goto done directly.
