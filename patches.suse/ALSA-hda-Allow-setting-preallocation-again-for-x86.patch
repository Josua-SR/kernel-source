Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: Allow setting preallocation again for x86
Git-commit: f8e4ae10de43fbb7ce85f79e04eca2988b6b2c40
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc2
References: jsc#SLE-16518

The commit c31427d0d21e ("ALSA: hda: No preallocation on x86
platforms") changed CONFIG_SND_HDA_PREALLOC_SIZE setup and its default
to zero for x86, as the preallocation should work almost all cases.
However, this expectation was too naive; some applications try to
allocate as the max buffer size as possible, and it leads to the
memory exhaustion.  More badly, the commit changed the kconfig no
longer adjustable for x86, so you can't fix it statically (although it
can be still adjusted via procfs).

So, practically seen, it's more recommended to set a reasonable limit
for x86, too.  This patch follows to that experience, and changes the
default to 2048 and allow the kconfig adjustable again.

 	  Specifies the default pre-allocated buffer-size in kB for the
 	  HD-audio driver.  A larger buffer (e.g. 2048) is preferred
 	  for systems using PulseAudio.  The default 64 is chosen just
 	  for compatibility reasons.
-	  On x86 systems, the default is zero as we need no preallocation.
+	  On x86 systems, the default is 2048 as a reasonable value for
+	  most of modern systems.
 
 	  Note that the pre-allocation size can be changed dynamically
 	  via a proc file (/proc/asound/card*/pcm*/sub*/prealloc), too.
