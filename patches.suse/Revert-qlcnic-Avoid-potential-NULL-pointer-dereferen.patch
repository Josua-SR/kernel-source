Subject: Revert "qlcnic: Avoid potential NULL pointer dereference"
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc3
Git-commit: b95b57dfe7a142bf2446548eb7f49340fd73e78b
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 5bf7295fe34a5251b1d241b9736af4697b590670.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

This commit does not properly detect if an error happens because the
logic after this loop will not detect that there was a failed
allocation.
