Subject: spi: document CS setup, hold & inactive times in header

Git-commit: a3470c1829c0c856a19c10af58f8e7792ae27d7a
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-15847

This change documents the CS setup, host & inactive times. They were
omitted when the fields were added, and were caught by one of the build
bots.

Fixes: 25093bdeb6bc ("spi: implement SW control for CS times")
