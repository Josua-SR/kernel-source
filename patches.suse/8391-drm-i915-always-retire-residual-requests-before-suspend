Subject: drm/i915: Always retire residual requests before suspend
Git-commit: 01f8f33e9986aed42a0366704f715cf30e7cb41c
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

If the driver is wedged, we skip idling the GPU. However, we may still
have a few requests still not retired following the wedging (since they
will be waiting for a background worker trying to acquire struct_mutex).
As we hold the struct_mutex, always do a quick request retirement in
order to flush the wedged path.
