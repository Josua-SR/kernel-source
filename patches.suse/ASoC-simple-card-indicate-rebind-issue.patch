Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: simple-card: indicate rebind issue
Git-commit: 39c66b6ef6f3aaf5bac61555db70ffb2864161c6
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16518

ALSA SoC try to rebind Sound Card if Card/CPU/Codec/Platform
were unbinded and re-binded again.
But, Simple Card might can't rebind again if user do for example

	unbind CPU or Codec driver
	bind   CPU or Codec driver

Because Simple Card is still pointing old/unbinded
CPU or Codec driver's DAI name at dlc->dai_name.

To avoid this issue, it needs to alloc memory and keep DAI name
even though if CPU or Codec driver was unbinded.
Or, always do unbind/bind at Sound Card.

For now, this patch indicates this issue as FIXME.
