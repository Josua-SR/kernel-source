Subject: ionic: leave dev cmd request contents alone on FW timeout
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: 2530ba5af6040b24ad94818a188df1083a9aac0f
References: bsc#1167773

It is possible (but unlikely) that FW was busy and missed a heartbeat
check but is still alive and will process the pending request, so don't
clean the dev_cmd in this case.  This occasionally occurs when working
with a card that is supporting many devices and is trying to shut them
all down at once, but still wants to see that last LIF disable request.
