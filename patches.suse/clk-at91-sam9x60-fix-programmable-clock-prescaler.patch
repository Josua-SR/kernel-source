Subject: [PATCH] clk: at91: sam9x60: fix programmable clock prescaler
Git-commit: 66d9f5214c9ba1c151478f99520b6817302d50dc
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

The prescaler works as parent rate divided by (PRES + 1) (is_pres_direct == 1)
It does not work in the way of parent rate shifted to the right by (PRES + 1),
which means division by 2^(PRES + 1) (is_pres_direct == 0)
Thus is_pres_direct must be enabled for this SoC, to make the right computation.
This field was added in
commit 45b06682113b ("clk: at91: fix programmable clock for sama5d2")
SAM9X60 has the same field as SAMA5D2 in the PCK
