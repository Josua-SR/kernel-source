Subject: [PATCH] ata: Documentation, fix function names
Git-commit: 0fb596edaa52133fb877f509c2e5d907ee601d6b
Patch-Mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1175995,jsc#SLE-15608

ata_qc_prep no longer exists, there are ata_bmdma_qc_prep and
ata_bmdma_dumb_qc_prep instead. And most drivers do not use them, so
reword the paragraph.

ata_qc_issue_prot was renamed to ata_sff_qc_issue. ->tf_load is now
->sff_tf_load. Fix them.

And fix spelling supercede -> supersede.
