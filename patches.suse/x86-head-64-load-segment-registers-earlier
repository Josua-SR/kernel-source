Subject: x86/head/64: Load segment registers earlier
Git-commit: 7b99819dfb60268cc1c75f83c949bc4a09221bea
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-14337

Make sure segments are properly set up before setting up an IDT and
doing anything that might cause a #VC exception. This is later needed
for early exception handling.
