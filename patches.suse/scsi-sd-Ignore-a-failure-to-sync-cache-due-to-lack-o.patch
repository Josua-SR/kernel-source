Subject: scsi: sd: Ignore a failure to sync cache due to lack of authorization
Git-commit: 21e3d6c81179bbdfa279efc8de456c34b814cfd2
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc4
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

I've got a report about a UAS drive enclosure reporting back Sense: Logical
unit access not authorized if the drive it holds is password protected.
While the drive is obviously unusable in that state as a mass storage
device, it still exists as a sd device and when the system is asked to
perform a suspend of the drive, it will be sent a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE. If
that fails due to password protection, the error must be ignored.
