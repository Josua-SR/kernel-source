Subject: ice: docs fix a devlink info that broke a table
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc3
Git-commit: 4b7560c5e4bda24fcbd54337c87056833819c73b
References: jsc#SLE-12878

Changeset 410d06879c01 ("ice: add the DDP Track ID to devlink info")
added description for a new devlink field, but forgot to add
one of its columns, causing it to break:

	.../Documentation/networking/devlink/ice.rst:15: WARNING: Error parsing content block for the "list-table" directive: uniform two-level bullet list expected, but row 11 does not contain the same number of items as row 1 (3 vs 4).

	.. list-table:: devlink info versions implemented
	    :widths: 5 5 5 90
...
	    * - ``fw.app.bundle_id``
	      - 0xc0000001
	      - Unique identifier for the DDP package loaded in the device. Also
	        referred to as the DDP Track ID. Can be used to uniquely identify
	        the specific DDP package.

Add the type field to the ``fw.app.bundle_id`` row.
