Subject: libbpf: fix Makefile exit code if libelf not found
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
Git-commit: 21567eded9805acbf69807671eb94d3536f797d0
References: bsc#1109837

/bin/sh's exit does not recognize -1 as a number, leading to
the following error message:

/bin/sh: 1: exit: Illegal number: -1

Use 1 as the exit code.
