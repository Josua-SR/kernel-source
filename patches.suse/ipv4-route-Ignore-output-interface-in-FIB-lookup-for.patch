Subject: ipv4: route: Ignore output interface in FIB lookup for PMTU route
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
Git-commit: df23bb18b44b9a1f2b54358201730e710a9df57f
References: bsc#1176447

Currently, processes sending traffic to a local bridge with an
encapsulation device as a port don't get ICMP errors if they exceed
the PMTU of the encapsulated link.

David Ahern suggested this as a hack, but it actually looks like
the correct solution: when we update the PMTU for a given destination
by means of updating or creating a route exception, the encapsulation
might trigger this because of PMTU discovery happening either on the
encapsulation device itself, or its lower layer. This happens on
bridged encapsulations only.

The output interface shouldn't matter, because we already have a
valid destination. Drop the output interface restriction from the
associated route lookup.

For UDP tunnels, we will now have a route exception created for the
encapsulation itself, with a MTU value reflecting its headroom, which
allows a bridge forwarding IP packets originated locally to deliver
errors back to the sending socket.

The behaviour is now consistent with IPv6 and verified with selftests
pmtu_ipv{4,6}_br_{geneve,vxlan}{4,6}_exception introduced later in
this series.

v2:
- reset output interface only for bridge ports (David Ahern)
- add and use netif_is_any_bridge_port() helper (David Ahern)
