Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Bias swapping tasks based on their
 preferred node

References: bnc#1155798 (CPU scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git
Git-commit: 88cca72c9673e631b63eca7a1dba4a9722a3f414

When swapping tasks for NUMA balancing, it is preferred that tasks move
to or remain on their preferred node. When considering an imbalance,
encourage tasks to move to their preferred node and discourage tasks from
moving away from their preferred node.
