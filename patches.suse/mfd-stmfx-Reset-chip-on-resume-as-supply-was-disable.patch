Subject: [PATCH] mfd: stmfx: Reset chip on resume as supply was disabled
Git-commit: e583649d87ec090444aa5347af0927cd6e8581ae
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

STMFX supply is disabled during suspend. To avoid a too early access to
the STMFX firmware on resume, reset the chip and wait for its firmware to
be loaded.

Fixes: 06252ade9156 ("mfd: Add ST Multi-Function eXpander (STMFX) core driver")
