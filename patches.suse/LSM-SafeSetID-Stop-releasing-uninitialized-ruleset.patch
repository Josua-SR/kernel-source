Subject: LSM: SafeSetID: Stop releasing uninitialized ruleset
Git-commit: 21ab8580b383f27b7f59b84ac1699cb26d6c3d69
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

The first time a rule set is configured for SafeSetID, we shouldn't be
trying to release the previously configured ruleset, since there isn't
one. Currently, the pointer that would point to a previously configured
ruleset is uninitialized on first rule set configuration, leading to a
crash when we try to call release_ruleset with that pointer.
