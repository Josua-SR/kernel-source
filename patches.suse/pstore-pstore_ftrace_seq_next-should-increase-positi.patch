Subject: [PATCH] pstore: pstore_ftrace_seq_next should increase position index
Git-commit: 6c871b7314dde9ab64f20de8f5aa3d01be4518e8
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

In Aug 2018 NeilBrown noticed
commit 1f4aace60b0e ("fs/seq_file.c: simplify seq_file iteration code and interface")
"Some ->next functions do not increment *pos when they return NULL...
Note that such ->next functions are buggy and should be fixed.
A simple demonstration is

 dd if=/proc/swaps bs=1000 skip=1

Choose any block size larger than the size of /proc/swaps. This will
always show the whole last line of /proc/swaps"

/proc/swaps output was fixed recently, however there are lot of other
affected files, and one of them is related to pstore subsystem.

If .next function does not change position index, following .show function
will repeat output related to current position index.

There are at least 2 related problems:
- read after lseek beyond end of file, described above by NeilBrown
  "dd if=<AFFECTED_FILE> bs=1000 skip=1" will generate whole last list
- read after lseek on in middle of last line will output expected rest of
  last line but then repeat whole last line once again.

If .show() function generates multy-line output (like
pstore_ftrace_seq_show() does ?) following bash script cycles endlessly

 $ q=;while read -r r;do echo "$((++q)) $r";done < AFFECTED_FILE

Unfortunately I'm not familiar enough to pstore subsystem and was unable
to find affected pstore-related file on my test node.

If .next function does not change position index, following .show function
will repeat output related to current position index.
