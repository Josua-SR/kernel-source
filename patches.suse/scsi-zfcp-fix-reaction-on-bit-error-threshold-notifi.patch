Subject: scsi: zfcp: fix reaction on bit error threshold notification
Git-commit: 2190168aaea42c31bff7b9a967e7b045f07df095
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc4
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

On excessive bit errors for the FCP channel ingress fibre path, the channel
notifies us.  Previously, we only emitted a kernel message and a trace
record.  Since performance can become suboptimal with I/O timeouts due to
bit errors, we now stop using an FCP device by default on channel
notification so multipath on top can timely failover to other paths.  A new
module parameter zfcp.ber_stop can be used to get zfcp old behavior.

User explanation of new kernel message:

 * Description:
 * The FCP channel reported that its bit error threshold has been exceeded.
 * These errors might result from a problem with the physical components
 * of the local fibre link into the FCP channel.
 * The problem might be damage or malfunction of the cable or
 * cable connection between the FCP channel and
 * the adjacent fabric switch port or the point-to-point peer.
 * Find details about the errors in the HBA trace for the FCP device.
 * The zfcp device driver closed down the FCP device
 * to limit the performance impact from possible I/O command timeouts.
 * User action:
 * Check for problems on the local fibre link, ensure that fibre optics are
 * clean and functional, and all cables are properly plugged.
 * After the repair action, you can manually recover the FCP device by
 * writing "0" into its "failed" sysfs attribute.
 * If recovery through sysfs is not possible, set the CHPID of the device
 * offline and back online on the service element.
