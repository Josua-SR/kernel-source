Subject: bpf: fix formatting for bpf_perf_event_read() helper doc
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
Git-commit: 3bd5a09b529c03bac354c9d48e688ed2aca934fd
References: bsc#1109837

Some edits brought to the last iteration of BPF helper functions
documentation introduced an error with RST formatting. As a result, most
of one paragraph is rendered in bold text when only the name of a helper
should be. Fix it, and fix formatting of another function name in the
same paragraph.

Fixes: c6b5fb8690fa ("bpf: add documentation for eBPF helpers (42-50)")
