Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: fix kernel-doc build warning
Git-commit: 3f1185d6c9d3fe91aa85ec8d3f4d71207452c458
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: bsc#1121278

Fix kernel-doc build error. A symbol that ends with an underscore
character ('_') has special meaning in reST (reStructuredText), so add
a '*' to prevent this error and to indicate that there are several of
these values to choose from.

../sound/core/jack.c:312: ERROR: Unknown target name: "snd_jack_btn".
