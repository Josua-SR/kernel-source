Subject: [PATCH] dma-buf/sw_sync: fix document of sw_sync_create_fence_data
Git-commit: e56a0fbd5251b43cc11bf2be30b8f45d7a847903
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc1
References: bsc#794563

The structure should really be sw_sync_create_fence_data rather than
sw_sync_ioctl_create_fence which is the function name.
