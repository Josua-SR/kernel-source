Subject: drm/amd/display: Raise dispclk value for dce120 by 15%
Git-commit: 481f576c6c21bf0446eaa23623ef0262e9a5387c
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
References: bsc#1113956

[Why]

The DISPCLK value was previously requested to be 15% higher for all
ASICs that went through the dce110 bandwidth code path. As part of a
refactoring of dce_clocks and the dce110 set bandwidth codepath this
was removed for power saving considerations.

That change caused display corruption under certain hardware
configurations with Vega10.

[How]

The 15% DISPCLK increase is brought back but only on dce110 for now.
This is should be a temporary workaround until the root cause is sorted
out for why this occurs on Vega (or other ASICs, if reported).
