Subject: drm/i915/selftests: Use NOWARN for large allocations
Git-commit: c65c8b0f7a1f90e84c273e111fc9391c50c3c482
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

We may try to do a large kmalloc for the permutation array, falling back
to a smaller array/test if the first allocation fails. Since we are
intentionally trying a large allocation which may fail, pass __GFP_NOWARN.
