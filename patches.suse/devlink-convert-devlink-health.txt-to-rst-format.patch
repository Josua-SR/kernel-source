Subject: devlink: convert devlink-health.txt to rst format
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
Git-commit: f7555fd19903cb64ad9887875a47094bdb0ab0c2
References: jsc#SLE-12878

Update the devlink-health documentation to use the newer
ReStructuredText format.

Note that it's unclear what OOB stood for, and it has been left as-is
without a proper first-use expansion of the acronym.

+Devlink Health
+==============
+
+Background
+==========
+
+The ``devlink`` health mechanism is targeted for Real Time Alerting, in
+order to know when something bad happened to a PCI device.
+
+  * Provide alert debug information.
+  * Self healing.
+  * If problem needs vendor support, provide a way to gather all needed
+    debugging information.
+
+Overview
+========
+
+The main idea is to unify and centralize driver health reports in the
+generic ``devlink`` instance and allow the user to set different
+attributes of the health reporting and recovery procedures.
+
+The ``devlink`` health reporter:
+Device driver creates a "health reporter" per each error/health type.
+Error/Health type can be a known/generic (eg pci error, fw error, rx/tx error)
+or unknown (driver specific).
+For each registered health reporter a driver can issue error/health reports
+asynchronously. All health reports handling is done by ``devlink``.
+Device driver can provide specific callbacks for each "health reporter", e.g.:
+
+  * Recovery procedures
+  * Diagnostics procedures
+  * Object dump procedures
+  * OOB initial parameters
+
+Different parts of the driver can register different types of health reporters
+with different handlers.
+
+Actions
+=======
+
+Once an error is reported, devlink health will perform the following actions:
+
+  * A log is being send to the kernel trace events buffer
+  * Health status and statistics are being updated for the reporter instance
+  * Object dump is being taken and saved at the reporter instance (as long as
+    there is no other dump which is already stored)
+  * Auto recovery attempt is being done. Depends on:
+    - Auto-recovery configuration
+    - Grace period vs. time passed since last recover
+
+User Interface
+==============
+
+User can access/change each reporter's parameters and driver specific callbacks
+via ``devlink``, e.g per error type (per health reporter):
+
+  * Configure reporter's generic parameters (like: disable/enable auto recovery)
+  * Invoke recovery procedure
+  * Run diagnostics
+  * Object dump

+
+   * - Name
+     - Description
+   * - ``DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_GET``
+     - Retrieves status and configuration info per DEV and reporter.
+   * - ``DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_SET``
+     - Allows reporter-related configuration setting.
+   * - ``DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_RECOVER``
+     - Triggers a reporter's recovery procedure.
+   * - ``DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_DIAGNOSE``
+     - Retrieves diagnostics data from a reporter on a device.
+   * - ``DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_DUMP_GET``
+     - Retrieves the last stored dump. Devlink health
+       saves a single dump. If an dump is not already stored by the devlink
+       for this reporter, devlink generates a new dump.
+       dump output is defined by the reporter.
+   * - ``DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_DUMP_CLEAR``
+     - Clears the last saved dump file for the specified reporter.
