Subject: [PATCH] nvmet-fc: check successful reference in
 nvmet_fc_find_target_assoc
Git-commit: 34efa23234c8b55dd178bba2216ca9ae9b50e1c9
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-15608

When searching for an association based on an association id, when there
is a match, the code takes a reference. However, it is not validating
that the reference taking was successful.

Check the status of the reference. If unsuccessful, the device is being
deleted and should be ignored.
