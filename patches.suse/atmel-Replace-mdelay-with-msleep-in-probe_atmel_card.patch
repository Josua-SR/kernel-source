Subject: [PATCH] atmel: Replace mdelay() with msleep() in probe_atmel_card()
Git-commit: 5685bee313e9e8577faebcb349706e299f486db5
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: FATE#326294

probe_atmel_card() is never called in atomic context.
It calls mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
