Subject: [PATCH] watchdog: explicitly update timestamp when reporting
 softlockup
Git-commit: c9ad17c991492f4390f42598f6ab0531f87eed07
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsc#1185982

The softlockup situation might stay for a long time or even forever.  When
it happens, the softlockup debug messages are printed in regular intervals
defined by get_softlockup_thresh().

There is a mystery.  The repeated message is printed after the full
interval that is defined by get_softlockup_thresh().  But the timer
callback is called more often as defined by sample_period.  The code looks
like the soflockup should get reported in every sample_period when it was
once behind the thresh.

It works only by chance.  The watchdog is touched when printing the stall
report, for example, in printk_stack_address().

Make the behavior clear and predictable by explicitly updating the
timestamp in watchdog_timer_fn() when the report gets printed.
