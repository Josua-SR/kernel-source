Subject: drm/i915/selftests: Skip making an object busy if the GPU is wedged
Git-commit: e16f4c36cb9bf61fcd70a2ea978cee2a23ebf71d
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

If the GPU is wedged, we cannot make the object busy as trying to
submit a request will generate -EIO. Skip to the end of the test.
