Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: stream: update state machine and add state checks
Git-commit: 59528807715f81f123631f57446b08219efa7526
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16518

The state machine and notes don't accurately explain or allow
transitions from STREAM_DEPREPARED and STREAM_DISABLED.

Add more explanations and allow for more transitions as a result of a
trigger_stop(), trigger_suspend() and prepare(), depending on the
ALSA/ASoC layer behavior defined by the INFO_RESUME and INFO_PAUSE
flags.

Also add basic checks to help debug inconsistent states and illegal
state machine transitions.

-NOTE: State transition between prepare and deprepare is supported in Spec
-but not in the software (subsystem)
+NOTE: State transitions between ``SDW_STREAM_ENABLED`` and
+``SDW_STREAM_DISABLED`` are only relevant when then INFO_PAUSE flag is
+supported at the ALSA/ASoC level. Likewise the transition between
+``SDW_DISABLED_STATE`` and ``SDW_PREPARED_STATE`` depends on the
+INFO_RESUME flag.
 
-NOTE2: Stream state transition checks need to be handled by caller
-framework, for example ALSA/ASoC. No checks for stream transition exist in
-SoundWire subsystem.
+NOTE2: The framework implements basic state transition checks, but
+does not e.g. check if a transition from DISABLED to ENABLED is valid
+on a specific platform. Such tests need to be added at the ALSA/ASoC
+level.
