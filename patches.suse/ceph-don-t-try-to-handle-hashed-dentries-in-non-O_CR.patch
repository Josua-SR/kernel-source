Subject: ceph: don't try to handle hashed dentries in non-O_CREAT atomic_open
Git-commit: 5bb5e6ee6f5c557dcd19822eccd7bcced1e1a410
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc7
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.11

If ceph_atomic_open is handed a !d_in_lookup dentry, then that means
that it already passed d_revalidate so we *know* that it's negative (or
at least was very recently). Just return -ENOENT in that case.

This also addresses a subtle bug in dentry handling. Non-O_CREAT opens
call atomic_open with the parent's i_rwsem shared, but calling
d_splice_alias on a hashed dentry requires the exclusive lock.

If ceph_atomic_open receives a hashed, negative dentry on a non-O_CREAT
open, and another client were to race in and create the file before we
issue our OPEN, ceph_fill_trace could end up calling d_splice_alias on
the dentry with the new inode with insufficient locks.
