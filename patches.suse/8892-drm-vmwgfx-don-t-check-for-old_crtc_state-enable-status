Subject: drm/vmwgfx: don't check for old_crtc_state enable status
Git-commit: bfc888261474efb0676f0e1d128f22c9692b97b1
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc5
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

During atomic check to prepare the new topology no need to check if
old_crtc_state was enabled or not. This will cause atomic_check to fail
because due to connector routing a crtc can be in atomic_state even if
there was no change to enable status.

Detected this issue with igt run.
