Subject: dma-buf: Improve CONFIG_DMABUF_MOVE_NOTIFY help text
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 518110cd0dedd7685ca365f464dd62c21c0a99e4
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Improve the help text for the CONFIG_DMABUF_MOVE_NOTIFY symbol by:
  1. Removing duplicated single quotes,
  2. Adding a missing subject,
  3. Fixing a misspelling of "yet",
  4. Wrapping long lines.

Fixes: bb42df4662a44765 ("dma-buf: add dynamic DMA-buf handling v15")
