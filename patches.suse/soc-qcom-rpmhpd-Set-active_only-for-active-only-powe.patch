Subject: [PATCH] soc: qcom: rpmhpd: Set 'active_only' for active only power domains
Git-commit: 5d0d4d42bed0090d3139e7c5ca1587d76d48add6
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

The 'active_only' attribute was accidentally never set to true for any
power domains meaning that all the code handling this attribute was
dead.

NOTE that the RPM power domain code (as opposed to the RPMh one) gets
this right.
