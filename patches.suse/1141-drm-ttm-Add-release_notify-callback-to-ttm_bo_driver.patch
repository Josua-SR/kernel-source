Subject: drm/ttm: Add release_notify callback to ttm_bo_driver
MIME-Version: 1.0

Git-commit: 274840e544225657fbca4f12efa1ee55474bb800
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

This notifies the driver that a BO is about to be released.

Releasing a BO also invokes the move_notify callback from
ttm_bo_cleanup_memtype_use, but that happens too late for anything
that would add fences to the BO and require a delayed delete.
