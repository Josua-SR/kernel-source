Subject: net/mlx5e: Force CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY for short ethernet frames
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc3
Git-commit: e8c8b53ccaff568fef4c13a6ccaf08bf241aa01a
References: bsc#1109837

When an ethernet frame is padded to meet the minimum ethernet frame
size, the padding octets are not covered by the hardware checksum.
Fortunately the padding octets are usually zero's, which don't affect
checksum. However, we have a switch which pads non-zero octets, this
causes kernel hardware checksum fault repeatedly.

Prior to:
commit '88078d98d1bb ("net: pskb_trim_rcsum() and CHECKSUM_COMPLETE ...")'
skb checksum was forced to be CHECKSUM_NONE when padding is detected.
After it, we need to keep skb->csum updated, like what we do for RXFCS.
However, fixing up CHECKSUM_COMPLETE requires to verify and parse IP
headers, it is not worthy the effort as the packets are so small that
CHECKSUM_COMPLETE can't save anything.

Fixes: 88078d98d1bb ("net: pskb_trim_rcsum() and CHECKSUM_COMPLETE are friends"),
