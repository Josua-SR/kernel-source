Subject: [PATCH] rtw88: coex: only skip coex triggered by BT info
Git-commit: 3f194bd4ca1cd9b8eef34d37d562279dbeb80319
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-13430, bsc#1176741

The coex mechanism used to skip upon the freeze flag is raised.
That will cause the coex mechanism being skipped unexpectedly.
Coex only wanted to keep the TDMA table from being changed by
BT side.

So, check the freeze and reason, if the coex reason is coming
from BT info, skip it, to make sure the coex triggered by Wifi
itself can work.

This is required for the AP mode, while the control flow is
different with STA mode. When starting an AP mode, the AP mode
needs to start working immedaitely after leaving IPS, and the
freeze flag could be raised. If the coex info is skipped, then
the AP mode will not set the antenna owner, leads to TX stuck.
