Subject: [PATCH] batman-adv: release station info tidstats
Git-commit: 7d652669b61d702c6e62a39579d17f6881670ab6
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc6
References: bsc#1111666

With the addition of TXQ stats in the per-tid statistics the struct
station_info grew significantly. This resulted in stack size warnings
due to the structure itself being above the limit for the warnings.

To work around this, the TID array was allocated dynamically. Also a
function to free this content was introduced with commit 7ea3e110f2f8
("cfg80211: release station info tidstats where needed") but the necessary
changes were not provided for batman-adv's B.A.T.M.A.N. V implementation.
