Subject: staging: fsl-mc: Add SPDX license identifiers

Git-commit: 203e2de32b00f321cd4a1ff87386567abb8eed70
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: fate#326530,fate#326531,fate#326535,fate#326538,fate#326539

The fsl-mc bus and dpio driver files use a combination of GPL-2.0 and
GPL-2.0+ OR BSD-3-Clause licenses. Add SPDX tags and delete the full
license text, keeping the existing license for each file. Add GPL-2.0
for Kconfig / Makefile, where not present.
