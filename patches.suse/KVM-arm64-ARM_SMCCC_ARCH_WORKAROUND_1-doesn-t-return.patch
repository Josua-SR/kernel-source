Subject: KVM: arm64: ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 doesn't return
 SMCCC_RET_NOT_REQUIRED
Git-commit: 1de111b51b829bcf01d2e57971f8fd07a665fa3f
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc2
References: git-fixes

According to the SMCCC spec[1](7.5.2 Discovery) the
ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 function id only returns 0, 1, and
SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED.

 0 is "workaround required and safe to call this function"
 1 is "workaround not required but safe to call this function"
 SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED is "might be vulnerable or might not be, who knows, I give up!"

SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED might as well mean "workaround required, except
calling this function may not work because it isn't implemented in some
cases". Wonderful. We map this SMC call to

 0 is SPECTRE_MITIGATED
 1 is SPECTRE_UNAFFECTED
 SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED is SPECTRE_VULNERABLE

For KVM hypercalls (hvc), we've implemented this function id to return
SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED, 0, and SMCCC_RET_NOT_REQUIRED. One of those
isn't supposed to be there. Per the code we call
arm64_get_spectre_v2_state() to figure out what to return for this
feature discovery call.

 0 is SPECTRE_MITIGATED
 SMCCC_RET_NOT_REQUIRED is SPECTRE_UNAFFECTED
 SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED is SPECTRE_VULNERABLE

Let's clean this up so that KVM tells the guest this mapping:

 0 is SPECTRE_MITIGATED
 1 is SPECTRE_UNAFFECTED
 SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED is SPECTRE_VULNERABLE

Note: SMCCC_RET_NOT_AFFECTED is 1 but isn't part of the SMCCC spec
