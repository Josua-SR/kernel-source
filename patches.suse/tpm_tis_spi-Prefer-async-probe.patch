Subject: tpm_tis_spi: Prefer async probe
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc4
Git-commit: 7187bf7f6297a8cfc74512a4493e06028626482d
References: jsc#SLE-15209

On a Chromebook I'm working on I noticed a big (~1 second) delay
during bootup where nothing was happening.  Right around this big
delay there were messages about the TPM:

[    2.311352] tpm_tis_spi spi0.0: TPM ready IRQ confirmed on attempt 2
[    3.332790] tpm_tis_spi spi0.0: Cr50 firmware version: ...

I put a few printouts in and saw that tpm_tis_spi_init() (specifically
tpm_chip_register() in that function) was taking the lion's share of
this time, though ~115 ms of the time was in cr50_print_fw_version().

Let's make a one-line change to prefer async probe for tpm_tis_spi.
There's no reason we need to block other drivers from probing while we
load.

NOTES:
* It's possible that other hardware runs through the init sequence
  faster than Cr50 and this isn't such a big problem for them.
  However, even if they are faster they are still doing _some_
  transfers over a SPI bus so this should benefit everyone even if to
  a lesser extent.
* It's possible that there are extra delays in the code that could be
  optimized out.  I didn't dig since once I enabled async probe they
  no longer impacted me.
