Subject: drm/docs: Align layout of optional plane blending properties
Git-commit: 4d10bd45d4f71c0b59db23cc6d8fe286976640ad
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

Just a bit of drive-by OCD. All the other property docs use enumerations,

name.
