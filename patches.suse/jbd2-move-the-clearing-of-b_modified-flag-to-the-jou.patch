Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: move the clearing of b_modified flag to the
 journal_unmap_buffer()
Git-commit: 6a66a7ded12baa6ebbb2e3e82f8cb91382814839
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc2
References: bsc#1163880

There is no need to delay the clearing of b_modified flag to the
transaction committing time when unmapping the journalled buffer, so
just move it to the journal_unmap_buffer().
