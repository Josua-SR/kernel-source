Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: FATE#325842

object_id and notify_id are in one union structure and their meaning is
defined by flags. Therefore do not print notify_id for non-event block and
do not print object_id for event block. Remove also reserved member as it
does not have any defined meaning or type yet.

As object_id and notify_id union members overlaps and have different types,
it caused that kernel print to dmesg binary data. This patch eliminates it.
