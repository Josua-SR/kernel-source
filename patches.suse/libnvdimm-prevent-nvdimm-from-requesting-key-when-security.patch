Subject: libnvdimm: prevent nvdimm from requesting key when security is disabled
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: 674f31a352da5e9f621f757b9a89262f486533a0
References: bsc#1137982

Current implementation attempts to request keys from the keyring even when
security is not enabled. Change behavior so when security is disabled it
will skip key request.

Error messages seen when no keys are installed and libnvdimm is loaded:

    request-key[4598]: Cannot find command to construct key 661489677
    request-key[4606]: Cannot find command to construct key 34713726
