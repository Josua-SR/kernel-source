+3.12 /proc/<pid>/arch_status - task architecture specific status
+-------------------------------------------------------------------
+When CONFIG_PROC_PID_ARCH_STATUS is enabled, this file displays the
+architecture specific status of the task.
+
+Example
+-------
+ $ cat /proc/6753/arch_status
+ AVX512_elapsed_ms:      8
+
+Description
+-----------
+
+x86 specific entries:
+---------------------
+ AVX512_elapsed_ms:
+ ------------------
+  If AVX512 is supported on the machine, this entry shows the milliseconds
+  elapsed since the last time AVX512 usage was recorded. The recording
+  happens on a best effort basis when a task is scheduled out. This means
+  that the value depends on two factors:
+
+    1) The time which the task spent on the CPU without being scheduled
+       out. With CPU isolation and a single runnable task this can take
+       several seconds.
+
+    2) The time since the task was scheduled out last. Depending on the
+       reason for being scheduled out (time slice exhausted, syscall ...)
+       this can be arbitrary long time.
+
+  As a consequence the value cannot be considered precise and authoritative
+  information. The application which uses this information has to be aware
+  of the overall scenario on the system in order to determine whether a
+  task is a real AVX512 user or not. Precise information can be obtained
+  with performance counters.
+
+  A special value of '-1' indicates that no AVX512 usage was recorded, thus
+  the task is unlikely an AVX512 user, but depends on the workload and the
+  scheduling scenario, it also could be a false negative mentioned above.
