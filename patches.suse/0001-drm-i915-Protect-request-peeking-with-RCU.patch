Subject: drm/i915: Protect request peeking with RCU
Git-commit: 8eb4704b124cbd44f189709959137d77063ecfa1
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Since the execlists_active() is no longer protected by the
engine->active.lock, we need to protect the request pointer with RCU to
prevent it being freed as we evaluate whether or not we need to preempt.

Fixes: df403069029d ("drm/i915/execlists: Lift process_csb() out of the irq-off spinlock")
Fixes: 13ed13a4dcbf ("drm/i915: Don't set queue_priority_hint if we don't kick the submission")
