Subject: mtd: spi-nor: Add support for sst26vf016b
Git-commit: 67de34c20fa7a7aeae50c55dd2751e6df80c3e2c
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-14214 jsc#SLE-16606

Adds support for sst26vf016b, a smaller variant of the sst26vf064b.
Tested on a sama5d3 SOC using the atmel,at91rm9200-spi controller.
The dual read could not be tested.

SPI_NOR_QUAD_READ is not added because it requires that the IOC bit
from the Configuration Register to be set to 1, which is not the case:
its default value at power-up is zero and we don't set it to one in
spi-nor either.
