Subject: drm/amd/display: Read AUX channel even if only status byte is returned
Git-commit: edf6ffe4f47e6749cfd45c1489feea2dbb0041c7
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

[Why]
get_channel_status() can return 0 in returned_bytes, and report a
successful operation result. This is because it prunes the first status
byte out. This was preventing read_channel_reply() from being called
(due to the faulty condition), and consequently preventing the AUX
reply status from being set.

[How]
Fix the conditional so that it accounts for when get_channel_status()
returns 0 bytes read.

[Fixes]
Fixes possible edid read failures during S3 resume, where we are now
relying on DRM's DP AUX handling. This was an regression introduced by:
