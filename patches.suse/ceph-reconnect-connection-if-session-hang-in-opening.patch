Subject: ceph: reconnect connection if session hang in opening state
Git-commit: 71a228bc8d65900179e37ac309e678f8c523f133
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.6

If client mds session is evicted in CEPH_MDS_SESSION_OPENING state,
mds won't send session msg to client, and delayed_work skip
CEPH_MDS_SESSION_OPENING state session, the session hang forever.

Allow ceph_con_keepalive to reconnect a session in OPENING to avoid
session hang. Also, ensure that we skip sessions in RESTARTING and
REJECTED states since those states can't be resurrected by issuing
a keepalive.
