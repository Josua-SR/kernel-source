Subject: [PATCH] staging: vc04_services: make a couple of pointers static
Git-commit: ca707dcadecff31ee5e1bda474018d68ae9c6fc1
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: FATE#324827

The pointers vchiq_dbg_dir and vchiq_dbg_clients are local to the
source and do not need to be in global scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
Warning: symbol 'vchiq_dbg_dir' was not declared. Should it be static?
Warning: symbol 'vchiq_dbg_clients' was not declared. Should it be static?
