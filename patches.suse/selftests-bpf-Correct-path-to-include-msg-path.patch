Subject: selftests/bpf: Correct path to include msg + path

References: bsc#1177028

The "path" buf is supposed to contain path + printf msg up to 24 bytes.
It will be cut anyway, but compiler generates truncation warns like:

"
samples/bpf/../../tools/testing/selftests/bpf/cgroup_helpers.c: In
function ‘setup_cgroup_environment’:
samples/bpf/../../tools/testing/selftests/bpf/cgroup_helpers.c:52:34:

				  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cgroup_path);
samples/bpf/../../tools/testing/selftests/bpf/cgroup_helpers.c:72:2:
note: ‘snprintf’ output between 24 and 4120 bytes into a destination

cgroup_path);
"

In order to avoid warns, lets decrease buf size for cgroup workdir on
24 bytes with assumption to include also "/cgroup.subtree_control" to
the address. The cut will never happen anyway.
