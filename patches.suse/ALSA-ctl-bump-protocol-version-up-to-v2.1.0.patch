Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: ctl: bump protocol version up to v2.1.0
Git-commit: bd3eb4e87eb399a9fe15ef1b59db78faf9c20359
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16518

In a development period for v5.6 kernel, some changes are introduced to
structures in ALSA control interface:
 - 'tstamp' member is removed from 'struct snd_ctl_elem_value
 - 'TSTAMP' flag is removed from a set of access flags for 'struct
   snd_ctl_elem_info'
 - 'dimen' member is removed from 'struct snd_ctl_elem_info

Although these changes were introduced with enough consideration for
backward compatibility, they include slightly lose of it. This commit
bumps protocol version of ALSA control interface up to v2.1.0.
