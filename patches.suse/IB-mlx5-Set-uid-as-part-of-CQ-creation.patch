Subject: IB/mlx5: Set uid as part of CQ creation
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
Git-commit: cf50a7863b424527c95ef41e2b26a03678cf009e
References: bsc#1103991 FATE#326007

Set uid as part of CQ creation so that the firmware can manage the
CQ object in a secured way.

The uid for the destroy and the modify commands is set by mlx5_core.

This will enable using a CQ that was created by verbs application to
be used by the DEVX flow in case the uid is equal.
