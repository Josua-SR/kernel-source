Subject: btrfs: convert some BUG_ON()'s to ASSERT()'s in do_relocation
Git-commit: ffe30dd892ad37f1193ae639ce7e2ad142a62721
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsc#1187833

A few of these are checking for correctness, and won't be triggered by
corrupted file systems, so convert them to ASSERT() instead of BUG_ON()
and add a comment explaining their existence.
