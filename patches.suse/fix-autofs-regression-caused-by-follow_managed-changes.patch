Subject: [PATCH] fix autofs regression caused by follow_managed() changes 
Git-commit: 508c8772760d4ef9c1a044519b564710c3684fc5
References: bsc#1159271
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc7

we need to reload ->d_flags after the call of ->d_manage() - the thing
might've been called with dentry still negative and have the damn thing
turned positive while we'd waited.
