Subject: [PATCH] batman-adv: Don't schedule OGM for disabled interface
Git-commit: 8e8ce08198de193e3d21d42e96945216e3d9ac7f
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc6
References: git-fixes

A transmission scheduling for an interface which is currently dropped by
batadv_iv_ogm_iface_disable could still be in progress. The B.A.T.M.A.N. V
is simply cancelling the workqueue item in an synchronous way but this is
not possible with B.A.T.M.A.N. IV because the OGM submissions are
intertwined.

Instead it has to stop submitting the OGM when it detect that the buffer
pointer is set to NULL.
