Subject: perf/x86/intel: Fix debug_store reset field for freq events
Git-commit: dc853e26f73e903e0c87e24f2695b5dcf33b3bc1
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc2
References: jsc#SLE-5373 (dependent patch)

There's a bug in PEBs event enabling code, that prevents PEBS
freq events to work properly after non freq PEBS event was run.

freq events - perf_event_attr::freq set
              -F <freq> option of perf record

PEBS events - perf_event_attr::precise_ip > 0
              default for perf record

Like in following example with CPU 0 busy, we expect ~10000 samples
for following perf tool run:

  # perf record -F 10000 -C 0 sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 2 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.640 MB perf.data (10031 samples) ]

Everything's fine, but once we run non freq PEBS event like:

  # perf record -c 10000 -C 0 sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 4 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 1.053 MB perf.data (20061 samples) ]

the freq events start to fail like this:

  # perf record -F 10000 -C 0 sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.185 MB perf.data (40 samples) ]

The issue is in non freq PEBs event initialization of debug_store reset
field, which value is used to auto-reload the counter value after PEBS
event drain. This value is not being used for PEBS freq events, but once
we run non freq event it stays in debug_store data and screws the
sample_freq counting for PEBS freq events.

Setting the reset field to 0 for freq events.
