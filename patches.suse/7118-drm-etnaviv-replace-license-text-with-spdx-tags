Subject: drm/etnaviv: replace license text with SPDX tags
Git-commit: f6ffbd4fc1a1caafe2ab840993b917fba5324598
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

This replaces the repetitive GPL-2.0 license text in code and header files
with the SPDX tags. Generated hardware headers aren't changed, as any changes
there need to be done in the upstream rnndb repository.
