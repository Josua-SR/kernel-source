Subject: staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: add SPDX license identifiers

Git-commit: 0bb29b25a008fe9d3a0f1ad3f9773225add35f08
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: fate#326530,fate#326531,fate#326535,fate#326538,fate#326539

The DPAA2 Ethernet driver files use a GPL-2.0+ OR BSD-3-Clause
license. Add SPDX tags and delete the full license text,
keeping the existing licenses for each file.
Add a GPL-2.0 tag for the Makefile.
