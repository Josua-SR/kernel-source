Subject: ARM: dts: aspeed-g5: Fixe gpio-ranges upper limit
Git-commit: 89b97c429e2e77d695b5133572ca12ec256a4ea4
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1164152

According to the AST2500/AST2520 specs, these SoCs support up to 228 GPIO
pins. However, 'gpio-ranges' value in 'aspeed-g5.dtsi' file is currently
setting the upper limit to 220 which isn't allowing access to all their
GPIOs. The correct upper limit value is 232 (actual number is 228 plus a
4-GPIO hole in GPIOAB). Without this patch, GPIOs AC5 and AC6 do not work
correctly on a AST2500 BMC running Linux Kernel v4.19
