Subject: ARM: dts: exynos: Mark LDO10 as always-on on Peach Pit/Pi Chromebooks
Git-commit: 5b0eeeaa37615df37a9a30929b73e9defe61ca84
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

Commit aff138bf8e37 ("ARM: dts: exynos: Add TMU nodes regulator supply
for Peach boards") assigned LDO10 to Exynos Thermal Measurement Unit,
but it turned out that it supplies also some other critical parts and
board freezes/crashes when it is turned off.

The mentioned commit made Exynos TMU a consumer of that regulator and in
typical case Exynos TMU driver keeps it enabled from early boot. However
there are such configurations (example is multi_v7_defconfig), in which
some of the regulators are compiled as modules and are not available
from early boot. In such case it may happen that LDO10 is turned off by
regulator core, because it has no consumers yet (in this case consumer
drivers cannot get it, because the supply regulators for it are not yet
available). This in turn causes the board to crash. This patch restores
'always-on' property for the LDO10 regulator.
