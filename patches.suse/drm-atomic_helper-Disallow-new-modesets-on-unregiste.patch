Subject: [PATCH] drm/atomic_helper: Disallow new modesets on unregistered connectors
Git-commit: e96550956fbcd090629c0e2b5b8cded2eded2adf
No-fix: 4d80273976bf880c4bed9359b8f2d45663140c86
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
References: bsc#1111666

With the exception of modesets which would switch the DPMS state of a
connector from on to off, we want to make sure that we disallow all
modesets which would result in enabling a new monitor or a new mode
configuration on a monitor if the connector for the display in question
is no longer registered. This allows us to stop userspace from trying to
enable new displays on connectors for an MST topology that were just
removed from the system, without preventing userspace from disabling
DPMS on those connectors.

Changes since v5:
- Fix typo in comment, nothing else
