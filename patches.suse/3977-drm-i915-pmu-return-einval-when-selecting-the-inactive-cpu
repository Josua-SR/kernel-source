Subject: drm/i915/pmu: Return -EINVAL when selecting the inactive CPU
Git-commit: 00a797225e53a4f488ab725e0b438c2970aa41d7
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

In commit 0426c0465461 ("drm/i915/pmu: Only allow running on a single
CPU") I attempted to clarify the CPU hotplug logic in our PMU
implementation, but missed that a more logical error to return, when
attempting to initialize an event on a currently inactive CPU, is -EINVAL
rather than -ENODEV.

This is because i915 PMU explicitly disallows running counters on more
than one CPU at a time, and is not reporting that the requested CPU does
not exist, or is off-line.
