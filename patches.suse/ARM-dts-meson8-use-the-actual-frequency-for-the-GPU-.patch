Subject: ARM: dts: meson8: use the actual frequency for the GPU's 182.1MHz OPP
Git-commit: fe634a7a9a57fb736e39fb71aa9adc6448a90f94
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: bsc#1164172

The clock setup on Meson8 cannot achieve a Mali frequency of exactly
182.15MHz. The vendor driver uses "FCLK_DIV7 / 2" for this frequency,
which translates to 2550MHz / 7 / 2 = 182142857Hz.
Update the GPU operating point to that specific frequency to not confuse
myself when comparing the frequency from the .dts with the actual clock
rate on the system.
