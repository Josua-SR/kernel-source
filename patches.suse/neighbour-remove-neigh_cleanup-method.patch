Subject: neighbour: remove neigh_cleanup() method
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc3
Git-commit: f394722fb0d0f701119368959d7cd0ecbc46363a
References: bsc#1154353

neigh_cleanup() has not been used for seven years, and was a wrong design.

Messing with shared pointer in bond_neigh_init() without proper
memory barriers would at least trigger syzbot complains eventually.

It is time to remove this stuff.
