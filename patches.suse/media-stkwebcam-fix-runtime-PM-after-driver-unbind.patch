Subject: media: stkwebcam: fix runtime PM after driver unbind
Git-commit: 30045f2174aab7fb4db7a9cf902d0aa6c75856a7
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.7

Since commit c2b71462d294 ("USB: core: Fix bug caused by duplicate
interface PM usage counter") USB drivers must always balance their
runtime PM gets and puts, including when the driver has already been
unbound from the interface.

Leaving the interface with a positive PM usage counter would prevent a
later bound driver from suspending the device.

Note that runtime PM has never actually been enabled for this driver
since the support_autosuspend flag in its usb_driver struct is not set.
