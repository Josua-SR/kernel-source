Subject: arm64: Fix kcore macros after 52-bit virtual addressing fallout
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc4
Git-commit: 86109a691a454e08cbe0356400268cb2a81f1997
References: jsc#SLE-16407

We export the entire kernel address space (i.e. the whole of the TTBR1
address range) via /proc/kcore. The kc_vaddr_to_offset() and
kc_offset_to_vaddr() macros are intended to convert between a kernel
virtual address and its offset relative to the start of the TTBR1
address space.

Prior to commit:

  14c127c957c1c607 ("arm64: mm: Flip kernel VA space")

... the offset was calculated relative to VA_START, which at the time
was the start of the TTBR1 address space. At this time, PAGE_OFFSET
pointed to the high half of the TTBR1 address space where arm64's
linear map lived.

That commit swapped the position of VA_START and PAGE_OFFSET, but
failed to update kc_vaddr_to_offset() or kc_offset_to_vaddr(), so
since then the two macros behave incorrectly.

Note that VA_START was subsequently renamed to PAGE_END in commit:

  77ad4ce69321abbe ("arm64: memory: rename VA_START to PAGE_END")

As the generic implementations of the two macros calculate the offset
relative to PAGE_OFFSET (which is now the start of the TTBR1 address
space), we can delete the arm64 implementation and use those.
