Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek - Add mute LED quirk for HP Spectre x360
Git-commit: 56e40eb6d656194e55ce2012fee9d5a496270aaa
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: bsc#1121278

This device has the same issues as the HP x360 wrt the MUTE LED and
the front speakers not working. This patch fixes the MUTE LED issue,
but doesn't touch the HDA verbs. The fix for the x360 does not work
on the Spectre.
