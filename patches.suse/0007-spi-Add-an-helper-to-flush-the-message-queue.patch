Subject: spi: Add an helper to flush the message queue

Git-commit: 988f259b46646934003ff8ae4966f7233691d1ad
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: fate#326572

This is needed by the spi-mem logic to force all messages that have been
queued before a memory operation to be sent before we start the memory
operation. We do that in order to guarantee that spi-mem operations do
not preempt regular SPI transfers.
