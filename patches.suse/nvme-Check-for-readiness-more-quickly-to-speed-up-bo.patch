Subject: [PATCH] nvme: Check for readiness more quickly, to speed up boot time
Git-commit: 3e98c2443f5c7f127b5b7492a3089e92a1c85112
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc7
References: bsc#1161930

After initialization, nvme_wait_ready checks for readiness every 100ms,
even though the drive may be ready far sooner than that. This delays
system boot by hundreds of milliseconds. Reduce the delay, checking for
readiness every millisecond instead.

Boot-time tests on an AWS c5.12xlarge:

Before:
[    0.546936] initcall nvme_init+0x0/0x5b returned 0 after 37 usecs
...
[    0.764178] nvme nvme0: 2/0/0 default/read/poll queues
[    0.768424]  nvme0n1: p1
[    0.774132] EXT4-fs (nvme0n1p1): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)
[    0.774146] VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) on device 259:1.
...
[    0.788141] Run /sbin/init as init process
