Subject: arm64: cpufeature: Remove redundant "feature" in reports

Git-commit: e0f6429dc1c0aeac8439e16a0c8e2539f401190f
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc1
References: fate#325862

The word "feature" is repeated in the CPU features reporting. This drops it
for improved readability.

Before (redundant "feature" word):

 SMP: Total of 4 processors activated.
 CPU features: detected feature: 32-bit EL0 Support
 CPU features: detected feature: Kernel page table isolation (KPTI)
 CPU features: emulated: Privileged Access Never (PAN) using TTBR0_EL1 switching
 CPU: All CPU(s) started at EL2

After:

 SMP: Total of 4 processors activated.
 CPU features: detected: 32-bit EL0 Support
 CPU features: detected: Kernel page table isolation (KPTI)
 CPU features: emulated: Privileged Access Never (PAN) using TTBR0_EL1 switching
 CPU: All CPU(s) started at EL2
