Subject: ice: cleanup language in ice.rst for fw.app
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc5
Git-commit: 709e7158f0991ec26b2819ef944c276a19b910db
References: bsc#1176447

The documentation for the ice driver around "fw.app" has a spelling
mistake in variation. Additionally, the language of "shall have a unique
name" sounds like a requirement. Reword this to read more like
a description or property.
