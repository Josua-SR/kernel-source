Subject: net/sched: cbs: remove redundant assignment to variable port_rate
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: 9367fa08415a6168f8ee2b5bb373362d75bfa860
References: bsc#1154353

Variable port_rate is being initialized with a value that is never read
and is being re-assigned a little later on. The assignment is redundant
and hence can be removed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
