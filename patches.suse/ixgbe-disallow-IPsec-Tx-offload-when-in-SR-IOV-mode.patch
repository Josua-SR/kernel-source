Subject: ixgbe: disallow IPsec Tx offload when in SR-IOV mode
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
Git-commit: 47b6f50077e68bcd544f657526dad4bfdce7e87d
References: bsc#1113994 FATE#326315 FATE#326317

There seems to be a problem in the x540's internal switch wherein if SR-IOV
mode is enabled and an offloaded IPsec packet is sent to a local VF,
the packet is silently dropped.  This might never be a problem as it is
somewhat a corner case, but if someone happens to be using IPsec offload
from the PF to a VF that just happens to get migrated to the local box,
communication will mysteriously fail.

Not good.

A simple way to protect from this is to simply not allow any IPsec offloads
for outgoing packets when num_vfs != 0.  This doesn't help any offloads that
were created before SR-IOV was enabled, but we'll get to that later.
