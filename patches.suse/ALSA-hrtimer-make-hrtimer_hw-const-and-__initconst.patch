Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hrtimer: make hrtimer_hw const and __initconst
Git-commit: 38405834a6abdf2a644c1384b97d8f0cca769350
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: bsc#1121278

Make this const as it is only used during a copy operation. Also, make
it __initconst as it is only used during the init phase and after this
it is not referenced anywhere.
