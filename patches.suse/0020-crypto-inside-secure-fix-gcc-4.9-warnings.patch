Subject: crypto: inside-secure - fix gcc-4.9 warnings
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Git-commit: 3e1166b94e661ed51af1fe1fe5f74bd83450b50f
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc2
References: fate#326470

All older compiler versions up to gcc-4.9 produce these
harmless warnings:

drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel_cipher.c:389:9: warning: missing braces around initializer [-Wmissing-braces]
drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel_cipher.c:389:9: warning: (near initialization for ‘result.completion’) [-Wmissing-braces]
drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel_hash.c:422:9: warning: missing braces around initializer [-Wmissing-braces]
drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel_hash.c:422:9: warning: (near initialization for ‘result.completion’) [-Wmissing-braces]

This changes the syntax to something that works on all versions
without warnings.

Fixes: 1b44c5a60c13 ("crypto: inside-secure - add SafeXcel EIP197 crypto engine driver")
