Subject: drm: document how user-space should use link-status
Git-commit: a66da873c424fd9a695ae945d6e0160bb467dcf9
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Describe what a "BAD" link-status means for user-space and how it should
handle it. The logic described has been implemented in igt [1].

v2:

- Change wording to avoid "enabled" (Daniel)
- Add paragraph about multiple connectors sharing the same CRTC (Pekka)
- Add paragraph about performing an atomic commit on a connector without
  updating the link-status property (Daniel)

v3:

- Fix description of what happens when link-status isn't reset to
  "GOOD", and when link-status is reset without ALLOW_MODESET (Daniel,
  Ville)
- Changing link-status to "BAD" is a no-op
- Clearly state that "BAD" means black screen (Manasi)
