Subject: opp: of: drop incorrect lockdep_assert_held()
Git-commit: f2edbb6699b0bc6e4f789846b99007200546c6c2
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc5
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

_find_opp_of_np() doesn't traverse the list of OPP tables but instead
just the entries within an OPP table and so only requires to lock the
OPP table itself.

The lockdep_assert_held() was added there by mistake and isn't really
required.

Fixes: 5d6d106fa455 ("OPP: Populate required opp tables from "required-opps" property")
