Subject: drm/msm/hdmi: Remove mmagic_iface_clk from the 8x96 PHY clocks
Git-commit: aacd9e6bdb7f7e66e779ca0316257cce667d3431
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

This was used as a placeholder. It was never really input to the MDSS/HDMI
clocks.
