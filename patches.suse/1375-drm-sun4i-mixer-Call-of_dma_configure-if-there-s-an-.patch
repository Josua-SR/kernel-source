Subject: drm/sun4i: mixer: Call of_dma_configure if there's an IOMMU
Git-commit: 842ec61f4006a6477a9deaedd69131e9f46e4cb5
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc3
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

The main DRM device is actually a virtual device so it doesn't have the
iommus property, which is instead on the DMA masters, in this case the
mixers.

Add a call to of_dma_configure with the mixers DT node but on the DRM
virtual device to configure it in the same way than the mixers.
