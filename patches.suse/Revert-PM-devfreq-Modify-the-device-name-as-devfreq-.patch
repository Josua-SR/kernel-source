Subject: [PATCH] Revert "PM / devfreq: Modify the device name as devfreq(X) for sysfs"
Git-commit: 66d0e797bf095d407479c89952d42b1d96ef0a7f
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc4
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 4585fbcb5331fc910b7e553ad3efd0dd7b320d14.

The name changing as devfreq(X) breaks some user space applications,
such as Android HAL from Unisoc and Hikey [1].
The device name will be changed unexpectly after every boot depending
on module init sequence. It will make trouble to setup some system
configuration like selinux for Android.

So we'd like to revert it back to old naming rule before any better
way being found.
