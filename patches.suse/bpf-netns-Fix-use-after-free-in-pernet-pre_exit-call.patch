Subject: bpf, netns: Fix use-after-free in pernet pre_exit callback
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc5
Git-commit: 2576f87066dc08a11cb1c05f11d1eaa02148ef9e
References: bsc#1177028

Iterating over BPF links attached to network namespace in pre_exit hook is
not safe, even if there is just one. Once link gets auto-detached, that is
its back-pointer to net object is set to NULL, the link can be released and
freed without waiting on netns_bpf_mutex, effectively causing the list
element we are operating on to be freed.

This leads to use-after-free when trying to access the next element on the
list, as reported by KASAN. Bug can be triggered by destroying a network
namespace, while also releasing a link attached to this network namespace.

Remove the "fast-path" for releasing a link that got auto-detached by a
dying network namespace to fix it. This way as long as link is on the list
and netns_bpf mutex is held, we have a guarantee that link memory can be
accessed.

An alternative way to fix this issue would be to safely iterate over the
list of links and ensure there is no access to link object after detaching
it. But, at the moment, optimizing synchronization overhead on link release
without a workload in mind seems like an overkill.
