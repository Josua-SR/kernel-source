Subject: USB: legousbtower: fix use-after-free on release
Git-commit: 726b55d0e22ca72c69c947af87785c830289ddbc
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.7

The driver was accessing its struct usb_device in its release()
callback without holding a reference. This would lead to a
use-after-free whenever the device was disconnected while the character
device was still open.

Fixes: fef526cae700 ("USB: legousbtower: remove custom debug macro")
