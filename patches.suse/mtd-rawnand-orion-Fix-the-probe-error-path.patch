Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: orion: Fix the probe error path
Git-commit: be238fbf78e4c7c586dac235ab967d3e565a4d1a
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

nand_release() is supposed be called after MTD device registration.
Here, only nand_scan() happened, so use nand_cleanup() instead.

There is no real Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
in this driver predates by far the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
which makes this change possible. However, pointing this commit as the
culprit for backporting purposes makes sense even if this commit is not
introducing any bug.
