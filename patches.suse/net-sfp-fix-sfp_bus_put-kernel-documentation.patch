Subject: net: sfp: fix sfp_bus_put() kernel documentation
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: 2fca4ac914a16c85721a83fa30cc586faf46ca18
References: bsc#1154353

The kbuild test robot found a problem with htmldocs with the recent
change to the SFP interfaces.  Fix the kernel documentation for
sfp_bus_put() which was missing an '@' before the argument name
description.
