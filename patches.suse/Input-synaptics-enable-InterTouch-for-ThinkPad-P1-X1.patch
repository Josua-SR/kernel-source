Subject: [PATCH] Input: synaptics - enable InterTouch for ThinkPad P1/X1E gen 2
Git-commit: 127e4a1bc11e0e3d30f4d20bb888a1f680296990
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: bsc#1180870

With the new RMI4 F3A support, we're now able to enable full RMI4
support for this model. We also tidy up the comments a bit, as the X1E
is essentially the same computer as the P1.
