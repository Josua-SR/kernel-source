Subject: libnvdimm, namespace: remove redundant initialization of 'nd_mapping'
Git-commit: 59858d3d54cfad1f8db67c2c07e4dd33bb6ed955
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: FATE#326060

can be removed.

drivers/nvdimm/namespace_devs.c:2411:21: warning: Value stored to
'nd_mapping' during its initialization is never rea
