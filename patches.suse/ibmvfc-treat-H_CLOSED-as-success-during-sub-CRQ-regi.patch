Subject: [PATCH 3/5] ibmvfc: treat H_CLOSED as success during sub-CRQ
 registration

References: bsc#1182632 ltc#191222
Patch-mainline: submitted https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=231116

A non-zero return code for H_REG_SUB_CRQ is currently treated as a
failure resulting in failing sub-CRQ setup. The case of H_CLOSED should
not be treated as a failure. This return code translates to a successful
sub-CRQ registration by the hypervisor, and is meant to communicate back
that there is currently no partner VIOS CRQ connection established as of
yet. This is a common occurrence during a disconnect where the client
adapter can possibly come back up prior to the partner adapter.

For non-zero return code from H_REG_SUB_CRQ treat a H_CLOSED as success
so that sub-CRQs are successfully setup.
