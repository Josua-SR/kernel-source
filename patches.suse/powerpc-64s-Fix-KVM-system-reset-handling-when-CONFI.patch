Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s: Fix KVM system reset handling when
 CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES=y

References: jsc#SLE-9246 git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc6
Git-commit: 575cba20c421ecb6b563ae352e4e0468e4ca8b3c

pseries guest kernels have a FWNMI handler for SRESET and MCE NMIs,
which is basically the same as the regular handlers for those
interrupts.

The system reset FWNMI handler did not have a KVM guest test in it,
although it probably should have because the guest can itself run
guests.

Commit 4f50541f6703b ("powerpc/64s/exception: Move all interrupt
handlers to new style code gen macros") convert the handler faithfully
to avoid a KVM test with a "clever" trick to modify the IKVM_REAL
setting to 0 when the fwnmi handler is to be generated (PPC_PSERIES=y).
This worked when the KVM test was generated in the interrupt entry
handlers, but a later patch moved the KVM test to the common handler,
and the common handler macro is expanded below the fwnmi entry. This
prevents the KVM test from being generated even for the 0x100 entry
point as well.

The result is NMI IPIs in the host kernel when a guest is running will
use gest registers. This goes particularly badly when an HPT guest is
running and the MMU is set to guest mode.

Remove this trickery and just generate the test always.
