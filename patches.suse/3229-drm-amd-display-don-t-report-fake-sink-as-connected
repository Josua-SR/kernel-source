Subject: drm/amd/display: Don't report fake sink as connected
Git-commit: 8580d60baed5c8c9f08a5c3b239e563c8966a9dc
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

This was missed in the previous fake sink change. The fake sink
allows us to enable a pipe with a disconnected display. We
shouldn't report it as connected.
