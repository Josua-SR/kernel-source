Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: sh: usb-dmac: set tx_result parameters
Git-commit: 466257d9968ac79575831250b039dc07566c7b13
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc6
References: git-fixes

A client driver (renesas_usbhs) assumed that
dmaengine_tx_status() could return the residue even if
the transfer was completed. However, this was not correct
usage [1] and this caused to break getting the residue after
the commit 24461d9792c2 ("dmaengine: virt-dma: Fix access after
free in vchan_complete()") actually. So, this is possible to get
wrong received size if the usb controller gets a short packet.
For example, g_zero driver causes "bad OUT byte" errors.

To use the tx_result from the renesas_usbhs driver when
the transfer is completed, set the tx_result parameters.

Notes that the renesas_usbhs driver needs to update for it.
