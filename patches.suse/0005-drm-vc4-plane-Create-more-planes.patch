Subject: drm/vc4: plane: Create more planes
Git-commit: 0ddd59c56e6b18919dc3f62ebaa615d4ec7daabd
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-15318

Let's now create more planes that can be affected to all the CRTCs.

vc4 has 3 CRTCs, 1 primary and 1 cursor each, and was having 24 (8
planes per CRTC) overlays.

However, vc5 has 5 CRTCs, so keeping the same logic would put us at 50
planes which is well above the 32 planes limit imposed by DRM.

Using 16 seems like a good tradeoff between staying under 32 and yet
providing enough planes.
