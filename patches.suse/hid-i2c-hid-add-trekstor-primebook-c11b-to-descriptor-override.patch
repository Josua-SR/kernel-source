Subject: HID: i2c-hid: add Trekstor Primebook C11B to descriptor override
Git-commit: 09f3dbe474735df13dd8a66d3d1231048d9b373f
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc6
References: git-fixes

The Primebook C11B uses the SIPODEV SP1064 touchpad. There are 2 versions
of this 2-in-1 and the touchpad in the older version does not supply
descriptors, so it has to be added to the override list.
