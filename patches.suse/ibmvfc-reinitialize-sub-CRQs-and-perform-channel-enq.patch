Subject: [PATCH 5/5] ibmvfc: reinitialize sub-CRQs and perform channel enquiry
 after LPM

References: bsc#1182632 ltc#191222
Patch-mainline: submitted https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=231116

A live partition migration (LPM) results in a CRQ disconnect similar to
a hard reset. In this LPM case the hypervisor moslty perserves the CRQ
transport such that it simply needs to be reenabled. However, the
capabilities may have changed such as fewer channels, or no channels at
all. Further, its possible that there may be sub-CRQ support, but no
channel support. The CRQ reenable path currently doesn't take any of
this into consideration.

For simpilicty release and reinitialize sub-CRQs during reenable, and
set do_enquiry and using_channels with the appropriate values to trigger
channel renegotiation.
