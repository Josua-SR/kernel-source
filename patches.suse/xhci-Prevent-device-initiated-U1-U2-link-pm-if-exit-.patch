Subject: xhci: Prevent device initiated U1/U2 link pm if exit latency is too
 long
Git-commit: cd9d9491e835a845c1a98b8471f88d26285e0bb9
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.7

If host/hub initiated link pm is prevented by a driver flag we still must
ensure that periodic endpoints have longer service intervals than link pm
exit latency before allowing device initiated link pm.

Fix this by continue walking and checking endpoint service interval if
xhci_get_timeout_no_hub_lpm() returns anything else than USB3_LPM_DISABLED

While at it fix the split line error message
