Subject: [PATCH] lightnvm: pblk: fix changing GC group list for a line
Git-commit: 27b978725d895e704aab44b99242a0514485d798

pblk_line_gc_list seems to had a bug since the introduction of pblk in
getting GC list for a line. In b20ba1bc7 while redesigning the GC
algorithm, the naming for the GC thresholds was altered, but the
values for high_thrs and mid_thrs were not. The result is that when
moving to the GC lists, the mid threshold is never evaluated.

Fixes: a4bd217b4("lightnvm: physical block device (pblk) target")
