Subject: drm: intel_dpio_phy: fix kernel-doc comments at nested struct
Git-commit: 41e1bd56487059f511a172db943c5791e2302bb2
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

The in-lined comments for channel.port doesn't follow the syntax
described at kernel-doc document, causing the following warning:

	$ ./scripts/kernel-doc -none drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_dpio_phy.c
	drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_dpio_phy.c:154: warning: Function parameter or member 'channel.port' not described in 'bxt_ddi_phy_info'

While the best would be for the Kernel to deduce that from the
context, supporting it is not trivial. So, let's just stick with
the existing syntax.

[Jani: depends on "scripts: kernel-doc: support in-line comments on
nested structs/unions" to actually fix the warning.]
