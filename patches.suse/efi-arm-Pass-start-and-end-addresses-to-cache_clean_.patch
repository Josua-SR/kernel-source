Subject: efi/arm: Pass start and end addresses to cache_clean_flush()
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: e951a1f427f2312e17b4e0f485e60068ca1423bb
References: jsc#SLE-16407

In preparation for turning the decompressor's cache clean/flush
operations into proper by-VA maintenance for v7 cores, pass the
start and end addresses of the regions that need cache maintenance
into cache_clean_flush in registers r0 and r1.

Currently, all implementations of cache_clean_flush ignore these
values, so no functional change is expected as a result of this
patch.
