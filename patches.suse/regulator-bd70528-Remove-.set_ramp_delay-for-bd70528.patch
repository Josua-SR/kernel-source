Subject: [PATCH] regulator: bd70528: Remove .set_ramp_delay for bd70528_ldo_ops
Git-commit: 6f1ff76154b8b36033efcbf6453a71a3d28f52cd
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc6
References: git-fixes

The .set_ramp_delay should be for bd70528_buck_ops only.
Setting .set_ramp_delay for for bd70528_ldo_ops causes problem because
BD70528_MASK_BUCK_RAMP (0x10) overlaps with BD70528_MASK_LDO_VOLT (0x1f).
So setting ramp_delay for LDOs may change the voltage output, fix it.
