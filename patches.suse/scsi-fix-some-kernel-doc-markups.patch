Subject: [PATCH] scsi: fix some kernel-doc markups
Git-commit: 739aca06a2d2d2c3435c526bca8b27a6c9a8c3e7
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: bsc#1118139

Sphinx is very pedantic with regards to ident/spacing.
Fix some kernel-doc markups in order to solve those
errors/warnings:

./drivers/scsi/scsicam.c:121: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
./drivers/scsi/scsicam.c:121: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

./drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:1057: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
./drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.c:2918: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.

./drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.c:2922: WARNING: Enumerated list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

No functional changes.
