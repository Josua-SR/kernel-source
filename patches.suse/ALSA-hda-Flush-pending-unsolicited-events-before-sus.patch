Subject: [PATCH 1/3] ALSA: hda: Flush pending unsolicited events before
 suspend
References: bsc#1182377
Git-commit: 13661fc48461282e43fe8f76bf5bf449b3d40687
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository

The HD-audio controller driver processes the unsolicited events via
its work asynchronously, and this might be pending when the system
goes to suspend.  When a lengthy event handling like ELD byte reads is
running, this might trigger unexpected accesses among suspend/resume
procedure, typically seen with Nvidia driver that still requires the
handling via unsolicited event verbs for ELD updates.

This patch adds the flush of unsol_work to assure that pending events
are processed before going into suspend.
