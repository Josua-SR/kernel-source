Subject: tcp, ulp: fix leftover icsk_ulp_ops preventing sock from reattach
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
Git-commit: 90545cdc3f2b2ea700e24335610cd181e73756da
References: bsc#1109837

I found that in BPF sockmap programs once we either delete a socket
from the map or we updated a map slot and the old socket was purged
from the map that these socket can never get reattached into a map
even though their related psock has been dropped entirely at that
point.

Reason is that tcp_cleanup_ulp() leaves the old icsk->icsk_ulp_ops
intact, so that on the next tcp_set_ulp_id() the kernel returns an
-EEXIST thinking there is still some active ULP attached.

BPF sockmap is the only one that has this issue as the other user,
kTLS, only calls tcp_cleanup_ulp() from tcp_v4_destroy_sock() whereas
sockmap semantics allow dropping the socket from the map with all
related psock state being cleaned up.
