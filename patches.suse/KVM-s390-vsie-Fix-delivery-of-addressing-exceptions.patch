Subject: KVM: s390: vsie: Fix delivery of addressing exceptions
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: 4d4cee96fb7a3cc53702a9be8299bf525be4ee98
References: bsc#1133021

Whenever we get an -EFAULT, we failed to read in guest 2 physical
address space. Such addressing exceptions are reported via a program
intercept to the nested hypervisor.

We faked the intercept, we have to return to guest 2. Instead, right
now we would be returning -EFAULT from the intercept handler, eventually
crashing the VM.
the correct thing to do is to return 1 as rc == 1 is the internal
representation of "we have to go back into g2".

Addressing exceptions can only happen if the g2->g3 page tables
reference invalid g2 addresses (say, either a table or the final page is
not accessible - so something that basically never happens in sane
environments.

Identified by manual code inspection.
