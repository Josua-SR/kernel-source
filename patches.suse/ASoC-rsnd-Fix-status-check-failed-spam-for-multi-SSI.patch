Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rsnd: Fix "status check failed" spam for multi-SSI
Git-commit: 54cb6221688660670a2e430892d7f4e6370263b8
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc3
References: git-fixes

Fix the rsnd_ssi_stop function to skip disabling the individual SSIs of
a multi-SSI setup, as the actual stop is performed by rsnd_ssiu_stop_gen2
- the same logic as in rsnd_ssi_start. The attempt to disable these SSIs
was harmless, but caused a "status check failed" message to be printed
for every SSI in the multi-SSI setup.
The disabling of interrupts is still performed, as they are enabled for
all SSIs in rsnd_ssi_init, but care is taken to not accidentally set the
EN bit for an SSI where it was not set by rsnd_ssi_start.
