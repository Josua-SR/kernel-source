Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ls1043a-rdb: correct RGMII delay mode to rgmii-id
Git-commit: 4022d808c45277693ea86478fab1f081ebf997e8
Patch-mainline: v5.6
References: bsc#1174398

The correct setting for the RGMII ports on LS1043ARDB is to
enable delay on both Rx and Tx so the interface mode used must
be PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID.

Since commit 1b3047b5208a80 ("net: phy: realtek: add support for
configuring the RX delay on RTL8211F") the Realtek 8211F PHY driver
has control over the RGMII RX delay and it is disabling it for
RGMII_TXID. The LS1043ARDB uses two such PHYs in RGMII_ID mode but
in the device tree the mode was described as "rgmii_txid".
This issue was not apparent at the time as the PHY driver took the
same action for RGMII_TXID and RGMII_ID back then but it became
visible (RX no longer working) after the above patch.

Changing the phy-connection-type to "rgmii-id" to address the issue.
