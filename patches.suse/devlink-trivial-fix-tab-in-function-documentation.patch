Subject: devlink: trivial: fix tab in function documentation
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: 6d82f67e2586cf6b090061ad301ae5f13fa1a0ee
References: jsc#SLE-15171

The function documentation comment for devlink_region_snapshot_create
included a literal tab character between 'future analyses' that was
difficult to spot as it happened to only display as one space wide.

Fix the comment to use a space here instead of a stray tab appearing in
the middle of a sentence.
