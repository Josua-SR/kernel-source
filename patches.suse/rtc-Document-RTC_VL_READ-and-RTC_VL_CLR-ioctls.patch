Subject: rtc: Document RTC_VL_READ and RTC_VL_CLR ioctls

Git-commit: 790a19f18a70bf1e30b6b4d00559e1bb8a3f7e23
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12251

RTC_VL_READ and RTC_VL_CLR have been introduced in 2012 with commit
0f20b767e20a ("drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf8563.c: add RTC_VL_READ/RTC_VL_CLR ioctl
feature")

Document them now that they have been unified.
