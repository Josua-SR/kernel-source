Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Rename dwc3 device nodes on rk3399 to make dtc happy
Git-commit: 190c7f6fd43a776d4a6da1dac44408104649e9b7
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc6
References: bsc#1175015

The device tree compiler complains that the dwc3 nodes have regs
properties but no matching unit addresses.

Add the unit addresses to the device node name. While at it, also rename
the nodes from "dwc3" to "usb", as guidelines require device nodes have
generic names.
