Subject: drm/i915: Make header i915_pmu.h more robust
Git-commit: 058a9b43a37a2406a574752707c5346e7b6444f4
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

Definitions in i915_pmu.h header depend on other types and
declarations that were not explicitly included. Fix that by
adding related headers and forward declarations.
While here, change license text to SPDX format.

v2: don't drop "intel_ringbuffer.h" (Tvrtko)
