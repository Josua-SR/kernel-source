Subject: cpuidle: teo: Consider hits and misses metrics of disabled states
Git-commit: e43dcf20215f0287ea113102617ca04daa76b70e
Patch-mainline: 5.5-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.17

The TEO governor uses idle duration "bins" defined in accordance with
the CPU idle states table provided by the driver, so that each "bin"
covers the idle duration range between the target residency of the
idle state corresponding to it and the target residency of the closest
deeper idle state.  The governor collects statistics for each bin
regardless of whether or not the idle state corresponding to it is
currently enabled.

In particular, the "hits" and "misses" metrics measure the likelihood
of a situation in which both the time till the next timer (sleep
length) and the idle duration measured after wakeup fall into the
given bin.  Namely, if the "hits" value is greater than the "misses"
one, that situation is more likely than the one in which the sleep
length falls into the given bin, but the idle duration measured after
wakeup falls into a bin corresponding to one of the shallower idle
states.

If the idle state corresponding to the given bin is disabled, it
cannot be selected and if it turns out to be the one that should be
selected, a shallower idle state needs to be used instead of it.
Nevertheless, the metrics collected for the bin corresponding to it
are still valid and need to be taken into account as though that
state had not been disabled.

For this reason, make teo_select() always use the "hits" and "misses"
values of the idle duration range that the sleep length falls into
even if the specific idle state corresponding to it is disabled and
if the "hits" values is greater than the "misses" one, select the
closest enabled shallower idle state in that case.
