Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: amd: Downgrade print level for invalid ACP mode
Git-commit: 2509bb342e476e740db448cce09c19b92905194e
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

The acp3x raven driver skips the probing when the given device isn't
connected with I2S.  This skip behavior itself is fine, but the driver
also emits an error message "Invalid ACP audio mode" with KERN_ERR.
This isn't nice since it appears on the boot screen even if a boot
splash is running, although this itself is no real error.

Downgrade the print level to KERN_INFO so that this message won't
appear on the console unnecessarily.
