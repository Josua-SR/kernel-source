Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: Fix current->fs handling in io_sq_wq_submit_work()

No upstream commit, this is a fix to a stable 5.4 specific backport.

The intention of backport commit cac68d12c531 ("io_uring: grab ->fs as part
of async offload") as found in the stable 5.4 tree was to make
io_sq_wq_submit_work() to switch the workqueue task's ->fs over to the
submitting task's one during the IO operation.

However, due to a small logic error, this change turned out to not have any
actual effect. From a high level, the relevant code in
io_sq_wq_submit_work() looks like

  old_fs_struct = current->fs;
  do {
          ...
          if (req->fs != current->fs && current->fs != old_fs_struct) {
                  task_lock(current);
                  if (req->fs)
                          current->fs = req->fs;
                  else
                          current->fs = old_fs_struct;
                  task_unlock(current);
          }
          ...
  } while (req);

The if condition is supposed to cover the case that current->fs doesn't
match what's needed for processing the request, but observe how it fails
to ever evaluate to true due to the second clause:
current->fs != old_fs_struct will be false in the first iteration as per
the initialization of old_fs_struct and because this prevents current->fs
from getting replaced, the same follows inductively for all subsequent
iterations.

Fix said if condition such that
- if req->fs is set and doesn't match current->fs, the latter will be
  switched to the former
- or if req->fs is unset, the switch back to the initial old_fs_struct
  will be made, if necessary.

While at it, also correct the condition for the ->fs related cleanup right
before the return of io_sq_wq_submit_work(): currently, old_fs_struct is
restored only if it's non-NULL. It is always non-NULL though and thus, the
if-condition is rendundant. Supposedly, the motivation had been to optimize
and avoid switching current->fs back to the initial old_fs_struct in case
it is found to have the desired value already. Make it so.
