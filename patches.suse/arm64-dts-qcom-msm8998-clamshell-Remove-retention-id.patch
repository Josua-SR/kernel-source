Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998-clamshell: Remove retention idle state
Git-commit: b40dd23f9a8987c8336df0a00e33f52b1f3f19ad
Patch-mainline: 5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

The retention idle state does not appear to be supported by the firmware
present on the msm8998 laptops since the state is advertised as disabled
in ACPI, and attempting to enable the state in DT is observed to result
in boot hangs.  Therefore, remove the state from use to address the
observed issues.
