Subject: PCI: xgene: Move to struct pci_host_bridge IRQ mapping functions

Git-commit: c62e98bdaa701fa1044b38d118d85950bda8eb85
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: fate#326572

struct pci_host_bridge gained hooks to map/swizzle IRQs, so that the IRQ
mapping can be done automatically by PCI core code through the
pci_assign_irq() function instead of resorting to arch-specific
implementation callbacks to carry out the same task which force PCI host
bridge drivers implementation to implement per-arch kludges to carry out a
task that is inherently architecture agnostic.

Add map/swizzle IRQs hooks to the xgene PCI host driver to move the IRQ
allocation into core code and stop relying on arch-specific callbacks.
