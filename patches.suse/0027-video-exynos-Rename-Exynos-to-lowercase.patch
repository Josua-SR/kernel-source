Subject: video: exynos: Rename Exynos to lowercase
Git-commit: 914d66312d46d877f2d306c1c940ee52b525ba1e
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Fix up inconsistent usage of upper and lowercase letters in "Exynos"
name.

"EXYNOS" is not an abbreviation but a regular trademarked name.
Therefore it should be written with lowercase letters starting with
capital letter.

The lowercase "Exynos" name is promoted by its manufacturer Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd., in advertisement materials and on website.
