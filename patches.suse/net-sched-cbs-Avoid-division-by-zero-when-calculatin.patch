Subject: net: sched: cbs: Avoid division by zero when calculating the port
 rate
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc2
Git-commit: 83c8c3cf45163f0c823db37be6ab04dfcf8ac751
References: bsc#1109837

As explained in the "net: sched: taprio: Avoid division by zero on
invalid link speed" commit, it is legal for the ethtool API to return
zero as a link speed. So guard against it to ensure we don't perform a
division by zero in kernel.
