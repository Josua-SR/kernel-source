Subject: ice: Update comment for ice_fltr_mgmt_list_entry
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
Git-commit: 8bc8d188cde0eeaacad3afd25b8c95ec74d1d217
References: bsc#1118661 FATE#325277

Previously the comment stated that VSI lists should be used when a
second VSI becomes a subscriber to the "VLAN address". VSI lists
are always used for VLAN membership, so replace "VLAN address" with
"MAC address". Also note that VLAN(s) always use VSI list rules.
