Subject: mtd: spi-nor: spansion: Enable dual and quad read for s25fl256s0
Git-commit: 954fd81ce83b7077b8e7b7b0fbf3ebf19d4eaff9
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-14214 jsc#SLE-16606

The s25fl256s0 supports dual and quad read like s25fl256s1.
Enable it by adding SPI_NOR_DUAL_READ and SPI_NOR_QUAD_READ
flags to the flash_info entry. Tested with the device and
confirmed that is working.
