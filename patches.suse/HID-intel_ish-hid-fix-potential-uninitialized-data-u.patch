Subject: [PATCH] HID: intel_ish-hid: fix potential uninitialized data usage
Git-commit: 1260662fa3f293042fb0ae124c9a621f29f5bcab
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-5241

gcc points out an uninialized pointer dereference that could happen
if we ever get to recv_ishtp_cl_msg_dma() or recv_ishtp_cl_msg()
with an empty &dev->read_list:

Drivers/hid/intel-ish-hid/ishtp/client.c: In function 'recv_ishtp_cl_msg_dma':
drivers/hid/intel-ish-hid/ishtp/client.c:1049:3: error: 'cl' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The warning only appeared in very few randconfig builds, as the
spinlocks tend to prevent gcc from tracing the variables. I only
saw it in configurations that had neither SMP nor LOCKDEP enabled.

As we can see, we only enter the case if 'complete_rb' is non-NULL,
and then 'cl' is known to point to complete_rb->cl. Adding another
initialization to the same pointer is harmless here and makes it
clear to the compiler that the behavior is well-defined.
