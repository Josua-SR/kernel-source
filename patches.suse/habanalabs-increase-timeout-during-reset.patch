Subject: [PATCH] habanalabs: increase timeout during reset
Git-commit: 7a65ee046b2238e053f6ebb610e1a082cfc49490
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

When doing training, the DL framework (e.g. tensorflow) performs hundreds
of thousands of memory allocations and mappings. In case the driver needs
to perform hard-reset during training, the driver kills the application and
unmaps all those memory allocations. Unfortunately, because of that large
amount of mappings, the driver isn't able to do that in the current timeout
(5 seconds). Therefore, increase the timeout significantly to 30 seconds
to avoid situation where the driver resets the device with active mappings,
which sometime can cause a kernel bug.

BTW, it doesn't mean we will spend all the 30 seconds because the reset
thread checks every one second if the unmap operation is done.
