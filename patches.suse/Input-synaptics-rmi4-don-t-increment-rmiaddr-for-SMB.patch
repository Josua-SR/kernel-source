Subject: Input: synaptics-rmi4 - don't increment rmiaddr for SMBus transfers
Git-commit: a284e11c371e446371675668d8c8120a27227339
Patch-mainline: 5.5-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.16

This increment of rmi_smbus in rmi_smb_read/write_block() causes
garbage to be read/written.

The first read of SMB_MAX_COUNT bytes is fine, but after that
it is nonsense. Trial-and-error showed that by dropping the
increment of rmiaddr everything is fine and the F54 function
properly works.

I tried a hack with rmi_smb_write_block() as well (writing to the
same F54 touchpad data area, then reading it back), and that
suggests that there too the rmiaddr increment has to be dropped.
It makes sense that if it has to be dropped for read, then it has
to be dropped for write as well.

It looks like the initial work with F54 was done using i2c, not smbus,
and it seems nobody ever tested F54 with smbus. The other functions
all read/write less than SMB_MAX_COUNT as far as I can tell, so this
issue was never noticed with non-F54 functions.

With this change I can read out the touchpad data correctly on my
Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th Gen laptop.
