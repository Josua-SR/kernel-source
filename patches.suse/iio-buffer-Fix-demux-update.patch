Subject: [PATCH] iio: buffer: Fix demux update

Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

When updating the buffer demux, we will skip a scan element from the
device in the case `in_ind != out_ind` and we enter the while loop.
in_ind should only be refreshed with `find_next_bit()` in the end of the
loop.

Note, to cause problems we need a situation where we are skippig over
an element (channel not enabled) that happens to not have the same size
as the next element.   Whilst this is a possible situation we haven't
actually identified any cases in mainline where it happens as most drivers
have consistent channel storage sizes with the exception of the timestamp
which is the last element and hence never skipped over.
