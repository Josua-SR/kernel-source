Subject: [PATCH] cfg80211: fix CFG82011_CRDA_SUPPORT still mentioning internal regdb
Git-commit: a3b018febccd3686c39e86e98b5081bde014fc66
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-13430

Back with commit c8c240e284b3 (cfg80211: reg: remove support for
built-in regdb, 2015-10-15), support for using CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB
was removed in favor of loading the regulatory database as firmware
file. The documentation of CFG80211_CRDA_SUPPORT was not adjusted,
though, which is why it still mentions mentions the old way of loading
via the internal regulatory database.

Remove it so that the kernel option only mentions using the firmware
file.
