Subject: [PATCH] mq-deadline: make it clear that __dd_dispatch_request() works
Git-commit: ca11f209a4c88743fb4b652fd812470e6fecc598
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1104967,FATE#325924
 on all hw queues

Don't pass in the hardware queue to __dd_dispatch_request(), since it
leads the reader to believe that we are returning a request for that
specific hardware queue. That's not how mq-deadline works, the state
for determining which request to serve next is shared across all
hardware queues for a device.
