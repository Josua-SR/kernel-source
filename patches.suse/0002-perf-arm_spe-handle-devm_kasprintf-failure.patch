Subject: perf: arm_spe: handle devm_kasprintf() failure

Git-commit: 754a58db6a556e6e5f5e32f3e84e7d67b5bf9c8e
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc1
References: bsc#1120668

devm_kasprintf() may return NULL on failure of internal allocation
thus the assignment to 'name' is not safe if unchecked. If NULL
is passed in for name then perf_pmu_register() would not fail
but rather silently jump to skip_type which is not the intent
here. As perf_pmu_register() may also return -ENOMEM returning
-ENOMEM in the (unlikely) failure case of devm_kasprintf() should
be fine here as well.
