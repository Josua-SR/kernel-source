Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: make snd_kcontrol_new name a normal string
Git-commit: 2a6eca16f376f6b83aaf73c57f0b6547907a5ed3
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc3
References: git-fixes

When building with W=2, there are lots of warnings about the
snd_kcontrol_new name field being an array of 'unsigned char'
but initialized to a string:

include/sound/soc.h:93:48: warning: pointer targets in initialization of 'const unsigned char *' from 'char *' differ in signedness [-Wpointer-sign]

Make it a regular 'char *' to avoid flooding the build log with this.
