Subject: [PATCH] docs: fix memory.low description in cgroup-v2.rst
Git-commit: 6ee0fac199e108f544b0ac23b2419a03ff6dc18f
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

The current cgroup-v2.rst file contains an incorrect description of when
memory is reclaimed from a cgroup that is using the 'memory.low'
mechanism. This fix simply corrects the text to reflect the actual
implementation.
