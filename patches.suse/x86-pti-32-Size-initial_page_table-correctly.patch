Subject: x86/pti/32: Size initial_page_table correctly
Git-commit: f490e07c53d66045d9d739e134145ec9b38653d3
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.14

Commit 945fd17ab6ba ("x86/cpu_entry_area: Sync cpu_entry_area to
initial_page_table") introduced the sync for the initial page table for
32bit.

sync_initial_page_table() uses clone_pgd_range() which does the update for
the kernel page table. If PTI is enabled it also updates the user space
page table counterpart, which is assumed to be in the next page after the
target PGD.

At this point in time 32-bit did not have PTI support, so the user space
page table update was not taking place.

The support for PTI on 32-bit which was introduced later on, did not take
that into account and missed to add the user space counter part for the
initial page table.

As a consequence sync_initial_page_table() overwrites any data which is
located in the page behing initial_page_table causing random failures,
e.g. by corrupting doublefault_tss and wreckaging the doublefault handler
on 32bit.

Fix it by adding a "user" page table right after initial_page_table.
