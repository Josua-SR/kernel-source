Subject: ARM: dts: am4372: Set memory bandwidth limit for DISPC
Git-commit: f90ec6cdf674248dcad85bf9af6e064bf472b841
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc2
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

Set memory bandwidth limit to filter out resolutions above 720p@60Hz to
avoid underflow errors due to the bandwidth needs of higher resolutions.

am43xx can not provide enough bandwidth to DISPC to correctly handle
'high' resolutions.
