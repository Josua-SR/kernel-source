Subject: [PATCH] mm/filemap.c: don't bother dropping mmap_sem for zero size
 readahead
Git-commit: 5c72feee3e45b40a3c96c7145ec422899d0e8964
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1168768

When handling a page fault, we drop mmap_sem to start async readahead so
that we don't block on IO submission with mmap_sem held.  However there's
no point to drop mmap_sem in case readahead is disabled.  Handle that case
to avoid pointless dropping of mmap_sem and retrying the fault.  This was
actually reported to block mlockall(MCL_CURRENT) indefinitely.

Fixes: 6b4c9f446981 ("filemap: drop the mmap_sem for all blocking operations")
