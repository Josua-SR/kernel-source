Subject: [PATCH] ath10k: fix not registering airtime of 11a station with WMM disable
Git-commit: f9680c75d187f2d5b9288c02f7a432041d4447b4
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-13430

The tid of 11a station with WMM disable reported by FW is 0x10 in
tx completion. The tid 16 is mapped to a NULL txq since buffer
MMPDU capbility is not supported. Then 11a station's airtime will
not be registered due to NULL txq check. As a results, airtime of
11a station keeps unchanged in debugfs system.

Mask the tid along with IEEE80211_QOS_CTL_TID_MASK to make it in
the valid range.
