Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: Fail if gold linker is detected

References: bcs#1181862
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: 75959d44f9dc8e44410667009724e4e238515502

The gold linker has known issues of failing the build both in random and in
predictible ways:

 - The x86/X32 VDSO build fails with:

   arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime-x32.o:vclock_gettime.c:function do_hres:
   error: relocation overflow: reference to 'hvclock_page'

   That's a known issue for years and the usual workaround is to disable
   CONFIG_X86_32

 - A recent build failure is caused by turning a relocation into an
   absolute one for unknown reasons. See link below.

 - There are a couple of gold workarounds applied already, but reports
   about broken builds with ld.gold keep coming in on a regular base and in
   most cases the root cause is unclear.

In context of the most recent fail H.J. stated:

  "Since building a workable kernel for different kernel configurations
   isn't a requirement for gold, I don't recommend gold for kernel."

So instead of dealing with attempts to duct tape gold support without
understanding the root cause and without support from the gold folks, fail
the build when gold is detected.
