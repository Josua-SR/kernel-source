Subject: netfilter: nf_tables: Allow set back-ends to report partial overlaps
 on insertion
Patch-mainline: v5.6
Git-commit: 8c2d45b2b65ca1f215244be1c600236e83f9815f
References: bsc#1176447

Currently, the -EEXIST return code of ->insert() callbacks is ambiguous: it
might indicate that a given element (including intervals) already exists as
such, or that the new element would clash with existing ones.

If identical elements already exist, the front-end is ignoring this without
returning error, in case NLM_F_EXCL is not set. However, if the new element
can't be inserted due an overlap, we should report this to the user.

To this purpose, allow set back-ends to return -ENOTEMPTY on collision with
existing elements, translate that to -EEXIST, and return that to userspace,
no matter if NLM_F_EXCL was set.
