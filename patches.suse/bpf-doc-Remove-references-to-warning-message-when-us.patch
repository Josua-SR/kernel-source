Subject: bpf, doc: Remove references to warning message when using
 bpf_trace_printk()
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
Git-commit: 7fb20f9e901e6df2f7dc032d88da5abff4117d37
References: bsc#1177028

The BPF helper bpf_trace_printk() no longer uses trace_printk();
it is now triggers a dedicated trace event.  Hence the described
warning is no longer present, so remove the discussion of it as
it may confuse people.

Fixes: ac5a72ea5c89 ("bpf: Use dedicated bpf_trace_printk event instead of trace_printk()")

-Q: bpf_trace_printk() helper warning
-------------------------------------
-Q: When bpf_trace_printk() helper is used the kernel prints nasty

-A: This is done to nudge program authors into better interfaces when
-programs need to pass data to user space. Like bpf_perf_event_output()
-can be used to efficiently stream data via perf ring buffer.
-BPF maps can be used for asynchronous data sharing between kernel
