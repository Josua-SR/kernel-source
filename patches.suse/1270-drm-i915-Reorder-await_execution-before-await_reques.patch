Subject: drm/i915: Reorder await_execution before await_request
Git-commit: dd873dd51d8d7868887048545d48befdd6bea7ad
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Reorder the code so that we can reuse the await_execution from a special
case in await_request in the next patch.
