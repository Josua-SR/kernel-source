Subject: ice: Use coalesce values from q_vector 0 when increasing q_vectors
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: a039f6fcba452fba5973798f4c641eee1ef770a1
References: jsc#SLE-12878

Currently when a VSI is built (i.e. reset, set channels, etc.)
the coalesce settings will be preserved in most cases. However, when the
number of q_vectors are increased the settings for the new q_vectors
will be set to the driver defaults of AIM on, Rx/Tx ITR 50, and INTRL 0.
This is causing issues with how the ethtool layer gets the current
coalesce settings since it only uses q_vector 0. So, assume that the user
set the coalesce settings globally (i.e. ethtool -C eth0) and use q_vector
0's settings for all of the new q_vectors.
