Subject: arm64: dts: imx8mm: Correct OPP table according to latest datasheet
Git-commit: cd7c2ddfda3629a18fcf6d20779bdcc73eda6bec
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1164203

According to latest datasheet (Rev.0.2, 04/2019) from below links,
1.8GHz is ONLY available for consumer part, so the market segment
bits for 1.8GHz opp should ONLY available for consumer part accordingly.
