Subject: iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Avoid memory corruption from Hisilicon MSI payloads
Git-commit: 84a9a75774961612d0c7dd34a1777e8f98a65abd
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc1
References: bsc#1126385

The GITS_TRANSLATER MMIO doorbell register in the ITS hardware is
architected to be 4 bytes in size, yet on hi1620 and earlier, Hisilicon
have allocated the adjacent 4 bytes to carry some IMPDEF sideband
information which results in an 8-byte MSI payload being delivered when
signalling an interrupt:

MSIAddr:
	 |----4bytes----|----4bytes----|
	 |    MSIData   |    IMPDEF    |

This poses no problem for the ITS hardware because the adjacent 4 bytes
are reserved in the memory map. However, when delivering MSIs to memory,
as we do in the SMMUv3 driver for signalling the completion of a SYNC
command, the extended payload will corrupt the 4 bytes adjacent to the
"sync_count" member in struct arm_smmu_device. Fortunately, the current
layout allocates these bytes to padding, but this is fragile and we
should make this explicit.
