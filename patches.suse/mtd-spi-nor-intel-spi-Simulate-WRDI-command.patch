Subject: mtd: spi-nor: intel-spi: Simulate WRDI command
Git-commit: 44a80df4bfce02f5d51fe5040bdbdf10d0d78f4e
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-14214 jsc#SLE-16606

After spi_nor_write_disable() return code checks were introduced in the
spi-nor front end intel-spi backend stopped to work because WRDI was never
supported and always failed.

Just pretend it was sucessful and ignore the command itself. HW sequencer
shall do the right thing automatically, while with SW sequencer we cannot
do it anyway, because the only tool we had was preopcode and it makes no
sense for WRDI.
