Subject: firmware: smccc: Update link to latest SMCCC specification
Git-commit: 15c704ab6244ac95be54b2c05411b70501d50e8f
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1174906

The current link gets redirected to the revision B published in November
2016 though it actually points to the original revision A published in
June 2013.

Let us update the link to point to the latest version, so that it
doesn't get stale anytime soon. Currently it points to v1.2 published in
March 2020(i.e. DEN0028C).
