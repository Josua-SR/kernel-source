Subject: coresight: etm4x: Use explicit barriers on enable/disable
Git-commit: 1004ce4c255fc3eb3ad9145ddd53547d1b7ce327
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.6

Synchronization is recommended before disabling the trace registers
to prevent any start or stop points being speculative at the point
of disabling the unit (section 7.3.77 of ARM IHI 0064D).

Synchronization is also recommended after programming the trace
registers to ensure all updates are committed prior to normal code
resuming (section 4.3.7 of ARM IHI 0064D).

Let's ensure these syncronization points are present in the code
and clearly commented.

Note that we could rely on the barriers in CS_LOCK and
coresight_disclaim_device_unlocked or the context switch to user
space - however coresight may be of use in the kernel.

On armv8 the mb macro is defined as dsb(sy) - Given that the etm4x is
only used on armv8 let's directly use dsb(sy) instead of mb(). This
removes some ambiguity and makes it easier to correlate the code with
the TRM.
