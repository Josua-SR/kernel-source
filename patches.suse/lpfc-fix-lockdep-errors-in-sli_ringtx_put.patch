Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix lockdep errors in sli_ringtx_put
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi.git
Git-commit: 27f3efd637ce4859a44a7ca730c72392b4111c26
References: bsc#1154521

Fix lockdep error in __lpfc_sli_ringtx_put():
The hbalock is valid for sli3, but not for sli4.
Change lockdep to look at ring lock if sli4.

Also update comment in __lpfc_sli_issue_iocb_s4()
to reflect proper lock. note: lockdep check is
already correct.
