UDF 2.60 standard states in section 2.2.14.2:

    A partition with Access Type 3 (rewritable) shall define a Freed
    Space Bitmap or a Freed Space Table, see 2.3.3. All other partitions
    shall not define a Freed Space Bitmap or a Freed Space Table.

    Rewritable partitions are used on media that require some form of
    preprocessing before re-writing data (for example legacy MO). Such
    partitions shall use Access Type 3.

    Overwritable partitions are used on media that do not require
    preprocessing before overwriting data (for example: CD-RW, DVD-RW,
    DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, BD-RE, HD DVD-Rewritable). Such partitions shall
    use Access Type 4.

however older versions of the standard didn't have this wording and
there are tools out there that create UDF filesystems with rewritable
partitions but that don't contain a Freed Space Bitmap or a Freed Space
Table on media that does not require pre-processing before overwriting a
block. So instead of forcing media with rewritable partition read-only,
base this decision on presence of a Freed Space Bitmap or a Freed Space
Table.
