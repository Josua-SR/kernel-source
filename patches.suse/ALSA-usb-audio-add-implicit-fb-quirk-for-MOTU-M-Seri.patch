Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: add implicit fb quirk for MOTU M Series
Git-commit: c249177944b650816069f6c49b769baaa94339dc
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

This fixes crackling sound during playback.

Further note: MOTU is known for reusing Product IDs for different
devices or different generations of the device (e.g. MicroBook
I/II/IIc shares a single Product ID). This patch was only tested with
M4 audio interface, but the same Product ID is also used by M2. Hope
it will work for M2 as well.
