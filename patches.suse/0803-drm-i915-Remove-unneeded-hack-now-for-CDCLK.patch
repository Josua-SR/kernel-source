Subject: drm/i915: Remove unneeded hack now for CDCLK
Git-commit: 82ea174dc5425d4e85e25d0c4ba961a2e494392a
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

No need to bump up CDCLK now, as it is now correctly
calculated, accounting for DBuf BW as BSpec says.
