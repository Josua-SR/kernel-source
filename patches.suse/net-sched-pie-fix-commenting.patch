Subject: net: sched: pie: fix commenting
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
Git-commit: 55f780c4a6c3046461352f4081427b077f8d06ed
References: jsc#SLE-15172

Fix punctuation and logical mistakes in the comments. The
logical mistake was that "dequeue_rate" is no longer the default
way to calculate queuing delay and is not needed. The default
way to calculate queue delay was changed in commit cec2975f2b70
("net: sched: pie: enable timestamp based delay calculation").
