Summary:     kernel: AP Crypto Passthrough 
Description: This adds support for AP crypto passthrough for 
             kvm guests.

Upstream-Description:

             KVM: s390: CPU model support for AP virtualization

             Introduces two new CPU model facilities to support
             AP virtualization for KVM guests:

             1. AP Query Configuration Information (QCI) facility is installed.

                This is indicated by setting facilities bit 12 for
                the guest. The kernel will not enable this facility
                for the guest if it is not set on the host.

                If this facility is not set for the KVM guest, then only
                APQNs with an APQI less than 16 will be used by a Linux
                guest regardless of the matrix configuration for the virtual
                machine. This is a limitation of the Linux AP bus.

             2. AP Facilities Test facility (APFT) is installed.

                This is indicated by setting facilities bit 15 for
                the guest. The kernel will not enable this facility for
                the guest if it is not set on the host.

                If this facility is not set for the KVM guest, then no
                AP devices will be available to the guest regardless of
                the guest's matrix configuration for the virtual
                machine. This is a limitation of the Linux AP bus.
