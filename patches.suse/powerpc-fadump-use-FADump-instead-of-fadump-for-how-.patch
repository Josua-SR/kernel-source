Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/fadump: use FADump instead of fadump for how it is
 pronounced

References: jsc#PM-1318 jsc#SLE-9099 jsc#SLE-9176
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: 1679b96e69ec2e10ccd9d82b691ade0b16cb64d1

fadump is pronounced f-a-dump. Update documentation accordingly. Also,
update how fadump_region contents look like with recent changes.
