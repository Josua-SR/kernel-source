Git-commit: c7cc144d8f625cfb8f338e66d875d0ec42fc399a

References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

Assert that we do not try to unsubmit a completed request, as should we
try to resubmit it later, the ring is already past the request's
breadcrumb and the breadcrumb will not be updated.
