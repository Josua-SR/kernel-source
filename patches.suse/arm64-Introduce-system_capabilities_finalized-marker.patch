Subject: arm64: Introduce system_capabilities_finalized() marker

Git-commit: b51c6ac220f77eb246e940442d970b4065c197b0
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#13705,jsc#13695

We finalize the system wide capabilities after the SMP CPUs
are booted by the kernel. This is used as a marker for deciding
various checks in the kernel. e.g, sanity check the hotplugged
CPUs for missing mandatory features.

However there is no explicit helper available for this in the
kernel. There is sys_caps_initialised, which is not exposed.
The other closest one we have is the jump_label arm64_const_caps_ready
which denotes that the capabilities are set and the capability checks
could use the individual jump_labels for fast path. This is
performed before setting the ELF Hwcaps, which must be checked
against the new CPUs. We also perform some of the other initialization
e.g, SVE setup, which is important for the use of FP/SIMD
where SVE is supported. Normally userspace doesn't get to run
before we finish this. However the in-kernel users may
potentially start using the neon mode. So, we need to
reject uses of neon mode before we are set. Instead of defining
a new marker for the completion of SVE setup, we could simply
reuse the arm64_const_caps_ready and enable it once we have
finished all the setup. Also we could expose this to the
various users as "system_capabilities_finalized()" to make
it more meaningful than "const_caps_ready".
