Subject: s390: Update kernel message documentation
Patch-mainline: never, SUSE-specific
References: LTC#174596, bsc#1121718

This patch updates the SLES15 SP1 kernel messages to the latest level,
which is required for the "kernel-default-man" rpm to provide correct
man pages.

Signed-off-by: Michael Holzheu <holzheu@linux.ibm.com>
Acked-by: Petr Tesarik <ptesarik@suse.cz>
