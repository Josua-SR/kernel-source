Subject: [PATCH] docs: driver-api: remove a duplicated index entry
Git-commit: d16eb0edf91760cac4d8cb09d8b9ab162424f0df
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

The ipmb file was added twice at index.rst. That
sounds to be because the same patch was applied twice,
via different git trees:

	commit f6ae22d64433fd8e08654adad7966299da931bb9
	Author: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
	Commit: Jonathan Corbet <corbet@lwn.net>

	    docs: ipmb: place it at driver-api and convert to ReST

	commit ac499fba98c3c65078fd84fa0a62cd6f6d5837ed
	Author: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
	Commit: Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	    docs: ipmb: place it at driver-api and convert to ReST

With Sphinx 4.0.0 development tree, a new warning is produced
due to that:

	.../Documentation/driver-api/index.rst:14: WARNING: duplicated entry found in toctree: driver-api/ipmb

The fix is trivial: just drop the duplicated line.
