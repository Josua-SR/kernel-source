Subject: iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Disable detection of ATS and PRI
Git-commit: b5e86196b83fd68e065a7c811ab8925fb0dc3893
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

Detecting the ATS capability of the SMMU at probe time introduces a
spinlock into the ->unmap() fast path, even when ATS is not actually
in use. Furthermore, the ATC invalidation that exists is broken, as it
occurs before invalidation of the main SMMU TLB which leaves a window
where the ATC can be repopulated with stale entries.

Given that ATS is both a new feature and a specialist sport, disable it
for now whilst we fix it properly in subsequent patches. Since PRI
requires ATS, disable that too.
