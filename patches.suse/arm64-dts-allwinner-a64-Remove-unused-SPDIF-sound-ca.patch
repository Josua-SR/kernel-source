Subject: arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Remove unused SPDIF sound card
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 29ee412bb7090023a8dba15726d9be2f4f2644a4
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc6
References: none bsc#1175016

As of v5.7-rc2, Linux now prints the following message at boot:

  [   33.848525] platform sound_spdif: deferred probe pending

This is because sound_spdif is waiting on its CPU DAI &spdif to probe,
but &spdif is disabled in the device tree.

Exposure of the SPDIF pin is board-specific functionality, so the sound
card and codec DAI belong in the individual board DTS, not the SoC DTSI.
In fact, no in-tree A64 board DTS enables &spdif, so let's remove the
card and DAI entirely.

This reverts commit 78e071370a86473f25923e03b51cbbadacf8be0f.
