Subject: KVM: x86: Return -E2BIG when KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID hits max entries
Git-commit: 68c9a46e9ee8e9f673c7e0d1bbf483a289b5a86f
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1183428

Fix a long-standing bug that causes KVM to return 0 instead of -E2BIG
when userspace's array is insufficiently sized.

This technically breaks backwards compatibility, e.g. a userspace with a
hardcoded cpuid->nent could theoretically be broken as it would see an
error instead of success if cpuid->nent is less than the number of
entries required to fully enumerate the host CPU.  But, the lowest known
cpuid->nent hardcoded by a VMM is 100 (lkvm and selftests), and the
limit for current processors on Intel and AMD is well under a 100.  E.g.
Intel's Icelake server with all the bells and whistles tops out at ~60
entries (variable due to SGX sub-leafs), and AMD's CPUID documentation
allows for less than 50.  CPUID 0xD sub-leaves on current kernels are
capped by the value of KVM_SUPPORTED_XCR0, and therefore so many subleaves
cannot have appeared on current kernels.

Note, while the Fixes: tag is accurate with respect to the immediate
bug, it's likely that similar bugs in KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID existed
prior to the refactoring, e.g. Qemu contains a workaround for the broken
KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID behavior that predates the buggy commit by over
two years.  The Qemu workaround is also likely the main reason the bug
has gone unreported for so long.

Qemu hack:

    kvm: work around supported cpuid ioctl() brokenness

    KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID has been known to fail to return -E2BIG
    when it runs out of entries. Detect this by always trying again
    with a bigger table if the ioctl() fills the table.
