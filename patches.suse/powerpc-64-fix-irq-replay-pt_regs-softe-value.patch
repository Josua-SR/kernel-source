Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64: fix irq replay pt_regs->softe value

References: jsc#SLE-9246 git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
Git-commit: 2b48e96be2f9f7151197fd25dc41487054bc6f5b

Replayed interrupts get an "artificial" struct pt_regs constructed to
pass to interrupt handler functions. This did not get the softe field
set correctly, it's as though the interrupt has hit while irqs are
disabled. It should be IRQS_ENABLED.

This is possibly harmless, asynchronous handlers should not be testing
if irqs were disabled, but it might be possible for example some code
is shared with synchronous or NMI handlers, and it makes more sense if
debug output looks at this.
