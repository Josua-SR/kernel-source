Subject: bpf: Avoid setting bpf insns pages read-only when prog is jited
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: e1608f3fa857b600045b6df7f7dadc70eeaa4496
References: bsc#1177028

For the case where the interpreter is compiled out or when the prog is jited
it is completely unnecessary to set the BPF insn pages as read-only. In fact,
on frequent churn of BPF programs, it could lead to performance degradation of
the system over time since it would break the direct map down to 4k pages when
calling set_memory_ro() for the insn buffer on x86-64 / arm64 and there is no
reverse operation. Thus, avoid breaking up large pages for data maps, and only
limit this to the module range used by the JIT where it is necessary to set
the image read-only and executable.
