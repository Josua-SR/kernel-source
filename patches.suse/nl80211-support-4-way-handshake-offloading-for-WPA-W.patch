Subject: [PATCH] nl80211: support 4-way handshake offloading for WPA/WPA2-PSK in AP mode
Git-commit: f96622749a67d40ad5efe8a58d5fc95313097aa0
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-13430

Let drivers advertise support for AP-mode WPA/WPA2-PSK 4-way handshake
offloading with a new NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_4WAY_HANDSHAKE_AP_PSK flag.

Extend use of NL80211_ATTR_PMK attribute indicating it might be passed
as part of NL80211_CMD_START_AP command, and contain the PSK (which is
the PMK, hence the name).

The driver is assumed to handle the 4-way handshake by itself in this
case, instead of relying on userspace.
