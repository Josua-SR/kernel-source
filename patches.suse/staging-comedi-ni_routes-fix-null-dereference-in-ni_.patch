Subject: [PATCH] staging: comedi: ni_routes: fix null dereference in ni_find_route_source()
Git-commit: 01e20b664f808a4f3048ca3f930911fd257209bd
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc7
References: git-fixes

In `ni_find_route_source()`, `tables->route_values` gets dereferenced.
However it is possible that `tables->route_values` is `NULL`, leading to
a null pointer dereference.  `tables->route_values` will be `NULL` if
the call to `ni_assign_device_routes()` during board initialization
returned an error due to missing device family routing information or
missing board-specific routing information.  For example, there is
currently no board-specific routing information provided for the
PCIe-6251 board and several other boards, so those are affected by this
bug.

The bug is triggered when `ni_find_route_source()` is called via
`ni_check_trigger_arg()` or `ni_check_trigger_arg_roffs()` when checking
the arguments for setting up asynchronous commands.  Fix it by returning
`-EINVAL` if `tables->route_values` is `NULL`.

Even with this fix, setting up asynchronous commands to use external
trigger sources for boards with missing routing information will still
fail gracefully.  Since `ni_find_route_source()` only depends on the
device family routing information, it would be better if that was made
available even if the board-specific routing information is missing.
That will be addressed by another patch.
