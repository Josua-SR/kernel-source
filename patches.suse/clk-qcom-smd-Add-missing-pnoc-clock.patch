Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: smd: Add missing pnoc clock
Git-commit: ba1d366de261981c0dd04fac44d2ce3a5eba2eaa
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

When MSM8998 support was added, and analysis was done to determine what
clocks would be consumed.  That analysis had a flaw, which caused the
pnoc to be skipped.  The pnoc clock needs to be on to access the uart
for the console.  The clock is on from boot, but has no consumer votes
in the RPM.  When we attempt to boot the modem, it causes the RPM to
turn off pnoc, which kills our access to the console and causes CPU hangs.

We need pnoc to be defined, so that clk_smd_rpm_handoff() will put in
an implicit vote for linux and prevent issues when booting modem.
Hopefully pnoc can be consumed by the interconnect framework in future
so that Linux can rely on explicit votes.
