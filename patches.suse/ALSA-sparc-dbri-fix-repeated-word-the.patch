 while another can be executed. The scheme works by adding two WAIT commands
 after each sent batch of commands. When the next batch is prepared it is
 added after the WAIT commands then the WAITs are replaced with single JUMP
-command to the new batch. The the DBRI is forced to reread the last WAIT
+command to the new batch. Then the DBRI is forced to reread the last WAIT
 command (replaced by the JUMP by then). If the DBRI is still executing
 previous commands the request to reread the WAIT command is ignored.
