Subject: drm/bridge: Fix the bridge kernel doc
Git-commit: 91ea83306bfa1fb0784ca09e55886a58345e0323
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Commit 751465913f04 ("drm/bridge: Add a drm_bridge_state object")
introduced new helpers and hooks but the kernel was slightly broken.
Fix that now.

v2:
* Fix the drm_atomic_add_encoder_bridges() doc
