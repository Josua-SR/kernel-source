Subject: seqlock: seqcount_LOCKNAME_t: Introduce PREEMPT_RT support
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
Git-commit: 8117ab508f9c476e0a10b9db7f4818f784cf3176
References: bsc#1176564 bsc#1162702

Preemption must be disabled before entering a sequence counter write
side critical section.  Otherwise the read side section can preempt the
write side section and spin for the entire scheduler tick.  If that
reader belongs to a real-time scheduling class, it can spin forever and
the kernel will livelock.

Disabling preemption cannot be done for PREEMPT_RT though: it can lead
to higher latencies, and the write side sections will not be able to
acquire locks which become sleeping locks (e.g. spinlock_t).

To remain preemptible, while avoiding a possible livelock caused by the
reader preempting the writer, use a different technique: let the reader
detect if a seqcount_LOCKNAME_t writer is in progress. If that's the
case, acquire then release the associated LOCKNAME writer serialization
lock. This will allow any possibly-preempted writer to make progress
until the end of its writer serialization lock critical section.

Implement this lock-unlock technique for all seqcount_LOCKNAME_t with
an associated (PREEMPT_RT) sleeping lock.
