Commit 25b4620ee822 ("drm/i915/dsi: Skip delays for v3 VBTs in vid-mode")
added an intel_dsi_msleep() helper which skips sleeping if the
MIPI-sequences have a version of 3 or newer and the panel is in vid-mode;
and it moved a bunch of msleep-s over to this new helper.

This was based on my reading of the big comment around line 730 which
starts with "Panel enable/disable sequences from the VBT spec.",
where the "v3 video mode seq" column does not have any wait t# entries.

Given that this code has been used on a lot of different devices without
issues until now, it seems that my interpretation of the spec here is
mostly correct.

But now I have encountered one device, an Acer Aspire Switch 10 E
SW3-016, where the panel will not light up unless we do actually honor the
panel_on_delay after exexuting the MIPI_SEQ_PANEL_ON sequence.

What seems to set this model apart is that it is lacking a
MIPI_SEQ_DEASSERT_RESET sequence, which is where the power-on
delay usually happens.

Fix the panel not lighting up on this model by using an unconditional
msleep(panel_on_delay) instead of intel_dsi_msleep() when there is
no MIPI_SEQ_DEASSERT_RESET sequence.
