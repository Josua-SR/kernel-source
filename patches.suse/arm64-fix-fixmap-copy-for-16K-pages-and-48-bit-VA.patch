Subject: arm64: fix fixmap copy for 16K pages and 48-bit VA
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: b333b0ba2346f2071390533b8f37f36f191d705d
References: jsc#SLE-16407

With 16K pages and 48-bit VAs, the PGD level of table has two entries,
and so the fixmap shares a PGD with the kernel image. Since commit:

  f9040773b7bbbd9e ("arm64: move kernel image to base of vmalloc area")

... we copy the existing fixmap to the new fine-grained page tables at
the PUD level in this case. When walking to the new PUD, we forgot to
offset the PGD entry and always used the PGD entry at index 0, but this
worked as the kernel image and fixmap were in the low half of the TTBR1
address space.

As of commit:

  14c127c957c1c607 ("arm64: mm: Flip kernel VA space")

... the kernel image and fixmap are in the high half of the TTBR1
address space, and hence use the PGD at index 1, but we didn't update
the fixmap copying code to account for this.

Thus, we'll erroneously try to copy the fixmap slots into a PUD under
the PGD entry at index 0. At the point we do so this PGD entry has not
been initialised, and thus we'll try to write a value to a small offset
from physical address 0, causing a number of potential problems.

Fix this be correctly offsetting the PGD. This is split over a few steps
for legibility.
