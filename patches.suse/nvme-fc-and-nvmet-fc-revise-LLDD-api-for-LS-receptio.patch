Subject: [PATCH] nvme-fc and nvmet-fc: revise LLDD api for LS reception and LS
Git-commit: 72e6329f86c714785ac195d293cb19dd24507880
Git-repo: git://git.infradead.org/nvme.git
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: bsc#1169045
 request

The current LLDD api has:
  nvme-fc: contains api for transport to do LS requests (and aborts of
    them). However, there is no interface for reception of LS's and sending
    responses for them.
  nvmet-fc: contains api for transport to do reception of LS's and sending
    of responses for them. However, there is no interface for doing LS
    requests.

Revise the api's so that both nvme-fc and nvmet-fc can send LS's, as well
as receiving LS's and sending their responses.

Change name of the rcv_ls_req struct to better reflect generic use as
a context to used to send an ls rsp. Specifically:
  nvmefc_tgt_ls_req -> nvmefc_ls_rsp
  nvmefc_tgt_ls_req.nvmet_fc_private -> nvmefc_ls_rsp.nvme_fc_private

Change nvmet_fc_rcv_ls_req() calling sequence to provide handle that
can be used by transport in later LS request sequences for an association.

nvme-fc nvmet_fc nvme_fcloop:
  Revise to adapt to changed names in api header.
  Change calling sequence to nvmet_fc_rcv_ls_req() for hosthandle.
  Add stubs for new interfaces:
    host/fc.c: nvme_fc_rcv_ls_req()
    target/fc.c: nvmet_fc_invalidate_host()

lpfc:
  Revise to adapt code to changed names in api header.
  Change calling sequence to nvmet_fc_rcv_ls_req() for hosthandle.

+ * nvmet_fc_invalidate_host - transport entry point called by an LLDD
+ *                       to remove references to a hosthandle for LS's.
+ *
+ * The nvmet-fc layer ensures that any references to the hosthandle
+ * on the targetport are forgotten (set to NULL).  The LLDD will
+ * typically call this when a login with a remote host port has been
+ * lost, thus LS's for the remote host port are no longer possible.
+ *
+ * If an LS request is outstanding to the targetport/hosthandle (or
+ * issued concurrently with the call to invalidate the host), the
+ * LLDD is responsible for terminating/aborting the LS and completing
+ * the LS request. It is recommended that these terminations/aborts
+ * occur after calling to invalidate the host handle to avoid additional
+ * retries by the nvmet-fc transport. The nvmet-fc transport may
+ * continue to reference host handle while it cleans up outstanding
+ * NVME associations. The nvmet-fc transport will call the
+ * ops->host_release() callback to notify the LLDD that all references
+ * are complete and the related host handle can be recovered.
+ * Note: if there are no references, the callback may be called before
+ * the invalidate host call returns.

+ *            received and which the response is to be sent for.
+ *            Used by the LLDD to pass the nvmet-fc transport (controller)

+ *
+ * The structure is allocated by the LLDD whenever a LS Request is received

+ * or nvme-fc layer via the xxx_rcv_ls_req() transport routines.
+ *

+ * when the response is to be transmit. The LLDD will use the address to
+ * map back to the LLDD exchange structure which maintains information such
+ * the remote N_Port that sent the LS as well as any FC exchange context.
+ * Upon completion of the LS response transmit, the LLDD will pass the
+ * address of the structure back to the transport LS rsp done() routine,
+ * allowing the transport release dma resources. Upon completion of
+ * the done() routine, no further access to the structure will be made by
+ * the transport and the LLDD can de-allocate the structure.

+ *   At the time of the xxx_rcv_ls_req() call, there is no content that
+ *     is valid in the structure.
