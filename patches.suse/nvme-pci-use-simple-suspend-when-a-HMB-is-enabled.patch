Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: use simple suspend when a HMB is enabled
Git-commit: b97120b15ebd3de51325084136d3b9c3cce656d6
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

While the NVMe specification allows the device to access the host memory
buffer in host DRAM from all power states, hosts will fail access to
DRAM during S3 and similar power states.
