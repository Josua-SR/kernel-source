Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: ch341: add new Product ID for CH341A
Git-commit: 46ee4abb10a07bd8f8ce910ee6b4ae6a947d7f63
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc7

Add PID for CH340 that's found on a ch341 based Programmer made by keeyees.
The specific device that contains the serial converter is described
here: http://www.keeyees.com/a/Products/ej/36.html

The driver works flawlessly as soon as the new PID (0x5512) is added to
it.
