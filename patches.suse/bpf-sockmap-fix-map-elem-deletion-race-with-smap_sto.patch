Subject: bpf, sockmap: fix map elem deletion race with smap_stop_sock
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
Git-commit: 166ab6f0a0702fdd4d865ad5090bf3094ed83428
References: bsc#1109837

The smap_start_sock() and smap_stop_sock() are each protected under
the sock->sk_callback_lock from their call-sites except in the case
of sock_map_delete_elem() where we drop the old socket from the map
slot. This is racy because the same sock could be part of multiple
sock maps, so we run smap_stop_sock() in parallel, and given at that
point psock->strp_enabled might be true on both CPUs, we might for
example wrongly restore the sk->sk_data_ready / sk->sk_write_space.
Therefore, hold the sock->sk_callback_lock as well on delete. Looks
like 2f857d04601a ("bpf: sockmap, remove STRPARSER map_flags and add
multi-map support") had this right, but later on e9db4ef6bf4c ("bpf:
sockhash fix omitted bucket lock in sock_close") removed it again
from delete leaving this smap_stop_sock() instance unprotected.

Fixes: e9db4ef6bf4c ("bpf: sockhash fix omitted bucket lock in sock_close")
