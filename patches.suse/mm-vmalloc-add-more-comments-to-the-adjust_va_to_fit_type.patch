Subject: [PATCH] mm/vmalloc: add more comments to the adjust_va_to_fit_type()

References: bnc#1155780 (VM/FS functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: 060650a2a0598d61bac6ce64578b176cb0e18b06

When fit type is NE_FIT_TYPE there is a need in one extra object.
Usually the "ne_fit_preload_node" per-CPU variable has it and there is
no need in GFP_NOWAIT allocation, but there are exceptions.

This commit just adds more explanations, as a result giving answers on
questions like when it can occur, how often, under which conditions and
what happens if GFP_NOWAIT gets failed.
