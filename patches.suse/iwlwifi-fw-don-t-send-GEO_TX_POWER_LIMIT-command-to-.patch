Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: fw: don't send GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT command to FW version 36
Git-commit: fddbfeece9c7882cc47754c7da460fe427e3e85b
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1111666

The intention was to have the GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT command in FW version
36 as well, but not all 8000 family got this feature enabled.  The
8000 family is the only one using version 36, so skip this version
entirely.  If we try to send this command to the firmwares that do not
support it, we get a BAD_COMMAND response from the firmware.

This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204151.
