Subject: arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: pine64-plus: Add PHY regulator delay
Git-commit: 2511366797fa6ab4a404b4b000ef7cd262aaafe8
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc5
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.10

Depending on kernel and bootloader configuration, it's possible that
Realtek ethernet PHY isn't powered on properly. According to the
datasheet, it needs 30ms to power up and then some more time before it
can be used.

Fix that by adding 100ms ramp delay to regulator responsible for
powering PHY.
