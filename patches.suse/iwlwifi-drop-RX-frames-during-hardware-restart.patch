Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: drop RX frames during hardware restart
Git-commit: 364a1ab91df160f96da5f8d9f778cfbafd5f6d81
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#326294

In case of a hardware restart the BA session data in HW is lost
so the reorder buffer simply passes the frames to mac80211 as is
as there is no NSSN set. Instead, we will drop these frames
before they reach the reorder buffer. mac80211 drops such frames anyway,
but we shouldn't rely on that. In addition it saves some
processing time
