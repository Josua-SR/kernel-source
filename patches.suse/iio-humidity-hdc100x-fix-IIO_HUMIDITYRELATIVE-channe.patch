Subject: iio: humidity: hdc100x: fix IIO_HUMIDITYRELATIVE channel reporting
Git-commit: 342a6928bd5017edbdae376042d8ad6af3d3b943
Patch-mainline: 5.5-rc2
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.17

The IIO_HUMIDITYRELATIVE channel was being incorrectly reported back
as percent when it should have been milli percent. This is via an
incorrect scale value being returned to userspace.
