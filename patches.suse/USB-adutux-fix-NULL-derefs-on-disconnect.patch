Subject: USB: adutux: fix NULL-derefs on disconnect
Git-commit: b2fa7baee744fde746c17bc1860b9c6f5c2eebb7
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.7

The driver was using its struct usb_device pointer as an inverted
disconnected flag, but was setting it to NULL before making sure all
completion handlers had run. This could lead to a NULL-pointer
dereference in a number of dev_dbg statements in the completion handlers
which relies on said pointer.

The pointer was also dereferenced unconditionally in a dev_dbg statement
release() something which would lead to a NULL-deref whenever a device
was disconnected before the final character-device close if debugging
was enabled.

Fix this by unconditionally stopping all I/O and preventing
resubmissions by poisoning the interrupt URBs at disconnect and using a
dedicated disconnected flag.

This also makes sure that all I/O has completed by the time the
disconnect callback returns.
