Subject: [PATCH] thunderbolt: Prevent crash if non-active NVMem file is read
Git-commit: 03cd45d2e219301880cabc357e3cf478a500080f
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc3
References: git-fixes

The driver does not populate .reg_read callback for the non-active NVMem
because the file is supposed to be write-only. However, it turns out
NVMem subsystem does not yet support this and expects that the .reg_read
callback is provided. If user reads the binary attribute it triggers
NULL pointer dereference like this one:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
  ...
  Call Trace:
   bin_attr_nvmem_read+0x64/0x80
   kernfs_fop_read+0xa7/0x180
   vfs_read+0xbd/0x170
   ksys_read+0x5a/0xd0
   do_syscall_64+0x43/0x150
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9

Fix this in the driver by providing .reg_read callback that always
returns an error.
