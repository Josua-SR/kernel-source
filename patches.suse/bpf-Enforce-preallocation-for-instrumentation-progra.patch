Subject: bpf: Enforce preallocation for instrumentation programs on RT
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: 2ed905c521e56aead6987df94c083efb0ee59895
References: bsc#1177028

Aside of the general unsafety of run-time map allocation for
instrumentation type programs RT enabled kernels have another constraint:

The instrumentation programs are invoked with preemption disabled, but the
memory allocator spinlocks cannot be acquired in atomic context because
they are converted to 'sleeping' spinlocks on RT.

Therefore enforce map preallocation for these programs types when RT is
enabled.
