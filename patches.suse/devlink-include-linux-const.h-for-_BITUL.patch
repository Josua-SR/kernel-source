Subject: devlink: include <linux/const.h> for _BITUL
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
Git-commit: 2ec13cbcfadbbeac499f3b63de0f7db490d45a7e
References: bsc#1176447

Commit 5d5b4128c4ca ("devlink: introduce flash update overwrite mask")
added a usage of _BITUL to the UAPI <linux/devlink.h> header, but failed
to include the header file where it was defined. It happens that this
does not break any existing kernel include chains because it gets
included through other sources. However, when including the UAPI headers
in a userspace application (such as devlink in iproute2), _BITUL is not
defined.
