Subject: drm/panfrost: Handle resetting on timeout better
Git-commit: 5b3ec8134f5f9fa1ed0a538441a495521078bbee
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc4
References: bsc#1152472

Panfrost uses multiple schedulers (one for each slot, so 2 in reality),
and on a timeout has to stop all the schedulers to safely perform a
reset. However more than one scheduler can trigger a timeout at the same
time. This race condition results in jobs being freed while they are
still in use.

When stopping other slots use cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure that
any timeout started for that slot has completed. Also use
mutex_trylock() to obtain reset_lock. This means that only one thread
attempts the reset, the other threads will simply complete without doing
anything (the first thread will wait for this in the call to
cancel_delayed_work_sync()).

While we're here and since the function is already dependent on
sched_job not being NULL, let's remove the unnecessary checks.
