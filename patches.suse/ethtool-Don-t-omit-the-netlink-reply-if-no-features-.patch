Subject: ethtool: Don't omit the netlink reply if no features were changed
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc2
Git-commit: f01204ec8be7ea5e8f0230a7d4200e338d563bde
References: bsc#1176447

The legacy ethtool userspace tool shows an error when no features could
be changed. It's useful to have a netlink reply to be able to show this
error when __netdev_update_features wasn't called, for example:

1. ethtool -k eth0
   large-receive-offload: off
2. ethtool -K eth0 rx-fcs on
3. ethtool -K eth0 lro on
   Could not change any device features
   rx-lro: off [requested on]
4. ethtool -K eth0 lro on
   # The output should be the same, but without this patch the kernel
   # doesn't send the reply, and ethtool is unable to detect the error.

This commit makes ethtool-netlink always return a reply when requested,
and it still avoids unnecessary calls to __netdev_update_features if the
wanted features haven't changed.
