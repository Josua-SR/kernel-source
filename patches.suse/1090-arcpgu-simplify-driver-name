Subject: arcpgu: Simplify driver name
Git-commit: 429ff616a5e8129e86312c841ca816d92f3cb8a1
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

This very minor change is still useful because it aligns
ARC PGU driver name with other DRM drivers and makes usage of
that driver name a bit easier.

For example in libdrm's test app we'll use "arcpgu" instead of
a bit more ugly "drm-arcpgu".
