Subject: closures: fix a race on wakeup from closure_sync
Git-commit: a22a9602b88fabf10847f238ff81fde5f906fef7
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

The race was when a thread using closure_sync() notices cl->s->done == 1
before the thread calling closure_put() calls wake_up_process(). Then,
it's possible for that thread to return and exit just before
wake_up_process() is called - so we're trying to wake up a process that
no longer exists.

rcu_read_lock() is sufficient to protect against this, as there's an rcu
barrier somewhere in the process teardown path.
