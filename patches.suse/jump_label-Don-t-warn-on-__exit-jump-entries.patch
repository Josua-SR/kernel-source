Subject: jump_label: Don't warn on __exit jump entries
Git-commit: 8f35eaa5f2de020073a48ad51112237c5932cfcc
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

On architectures that discard .exit.* sections at runtime, a
warning is printed for each jump label that is used within an
in-kernel __exit annotated function:

can't patch jump_label at ehci_hcd_cleanup+0x8/0x3c
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at kernel/jump_label.c:410 __jump_label_update+0x12c/0x138

As these functions will never get executed (they are free'd along
with the rest of initmem) - we do not need to patch them and should
not display any warnings.

The warning is displayed because the test required to satisfy
jump_entry_is_init is based on init_section_contains (__init_begin to
__init_end) whereas the test in __jump_label_update is based on
init_kernel_text (_sinittext to _einittext) via kernel_text_address).

Fixes: 19483677684b ("jump_label: Annotate entries that operate on __init code earlier")
