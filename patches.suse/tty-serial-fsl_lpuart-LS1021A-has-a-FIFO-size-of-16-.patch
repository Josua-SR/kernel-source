Subject: tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: LS1021A has a FIFO size of 16 words, like
 LS1028A

Git-commit: c97f2a6fb3dfbfbbc88edc8ea62ef2b944e18849
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc2
References: jsc#SLE-12251

Prior to the commit that this one fixes, the FIFO size was derived from
the read-only register LPUARTx_FIFO[TXFIFOSIZE] using the following
formula:

TX FIFO size = 2 ^ (LPUARTx_FIFO[TXFIFOSIZE] - 1)

The documentation for LS1021A is a mess. Under chapter 26.1.3 LS1021A
LPUART module special consideration, it mentions TXFIFO_SZ and RXFIFO_SZ
being equal to 4, and in the register description for LPUARTx_FIFO, it
shows the out-of-reset value of TXFIFOSIZE and RXFIFOSIZE fields as "011",
even though these registers read as "101" in reality.

And when LPUART on LS1021A was working, the "101" value did correspond
to "16 datawords", by applying the formula above, even though the
documentation is wrong again (!!!!) and says that "101" means 64 datawords
(hint: it doesn't).

So the "new" formula created by commit f77ebb241ce0 has all the premises
of being wrong for LS1021A, because it relied only on false data and no
actual experimentation.

Interestingly, in commit c2f448cff22a ("tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: add
LS1028A support"), Michael Walle applied a workaround to this by manually
setting the FIFO widths for LS1028A. It looks like the same values are
used by LS1021A as well, in fact.

When the driver thinks that it has a deeper FIFO than it really has,
getty (user space) output gets truncated.

Many thanks to Michael for pointing out where to look.
