Subject: ACPI: video: remove redundant assignments to variable result
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: 966f58df1753b436c9e16644c4c683a2395beb45
References: jsc#SLE-16407

The variable result is being initialized with a value that is never
read and it is being updated later with a new value. The initialization
is redundant and can be removed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
