Subject: vfio-pci: Mask cap zero
Git-commit: bc138db1b96264b9c1779cf18d5a3b186aa90066
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1175713

The PCI Code and ID Assignment Specification changed capability ID 0
from reserved to a NULL capability in the v1.1 revision.  The NULL
capability is defined to include only the 16-bit capability header,
ie. only the ID and next pointer.  Unfortunately vfio-pci creates a
map of config space, where ID 0 is used to reserve the standard type
0 header.  Finding an actual capability with this ID therefore results
in a bogus range marked in that map and conflicts with subsequent
capabilities.  As this seems to be a dummy capability anyway and we
already support dropping capabilities, let's hide this one rather than
delving into the potentially subtle dependencies within our map.

Seen on an NVIDIA Tesla T4.
