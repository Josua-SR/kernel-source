Subject: power: supply: sbs-battery: use correct flags field
Git-commit: 99956a9e08251a1234434b492875b1eaff502a12
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.6

the type flag is stored in the chip->flags field not in the
client->flags field. This currently leads to never using the ti
specific health function as client->flags doesn't use that bit.
So it's always falling back to the general one.
