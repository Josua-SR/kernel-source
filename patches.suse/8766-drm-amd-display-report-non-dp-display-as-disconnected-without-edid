Subject: drm/amd/display: Report non-DP display as disconnected without EDID
Git-commit: 01dc285d5cd89b77686d8baef8482c58d7dc3ead
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

[Why]
Some boards seem to have a problem where HPD is high on HDMI even though
no display is connected. We don't want to report these as connected. DP
spec still requires us to report DP displays as connected when HPD is
high but we can't read the EDID in order to go to fail-safe mode.

[How]
If connector_signal is not DP abort detection if we can't retrieve the
EDID.

v2: Add Bugzilla and stable
