Subject: selftests: Install settings files to fix TIMEOUT failures
Git-commit: b9167c8078c3527de6da241c8a1a75a9224ed90a
Patch-mainline: 5.6-rc4
References: git-fixes

Commit 852c8cbf34d3 ("selftests/kselftest/runner.sh: Add 45 second
timeout per test") added a 45 second timeout for tests, and also added
a way for tests to customise the timeout via a settings file.

For example the ftrace tests take multiple minutes to run, so they
were given longer in commit b43e78f65b1d ("tracing/selftests: Turn off
timeout setting").

This works when the tests are run from the source tree. However if the
tests are installed with "make -C tools/testing/selftests install",
the settings files are not copied into the install directory. When the
tests are then run from the install directory the longer timeouts are
not applied and the tests timeout incorrectly.

So add the settings files to TEST_FILES of the appropriate Makefiles
to cause the settings files to be installed using the existing install
logic.

[js] no mptcp in 5.3 yet.
