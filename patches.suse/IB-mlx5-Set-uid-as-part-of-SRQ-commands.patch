Subject: IB/mlx5: Set uid as part of SRQ commands
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
Git-commit: 9f33ec03bcdaf4f98023e6bfc6020304c10bb35a
References: bsc#1103991 FATE#326007

Set uid as part of SRQ create command so that the firmware can manage
the SRQ object in a secured way.

The uid for the destroy and modify commands are set by mlx5_core.

That will enable using a SRQ that was created by verbs application
to be used by the DEVX flow in case the uid is equal.
