Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: isa/wavefront: remove redundant assignment to pointer bptr
Git-commit: 3bb4aefd2aed628452b8ce544b76abda0ce531f0
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16518

The pointer bptr is being assigned a value that is never read
and it is being updated in the next statement with a new value.
The initialization is redundant and can be removed.

Addresses-coverity: ("Unused value")
