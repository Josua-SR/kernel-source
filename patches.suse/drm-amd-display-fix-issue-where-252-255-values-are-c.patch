Subject: drm/amd/display: fix issue where 252-255 values are clipped
Git-commit: 1cbcfc975164f397b449efb17f59d81a703090db
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.5

[Why]
When endpoint is at the boundary of a region, such as at 2^0=1
we find that the last segment has a sharp slope and some points
are clipped at the top.

[How]
If end point is 1, which is exactly at the 2^0 region boundary, we
need to program an additional region beyond this point.
