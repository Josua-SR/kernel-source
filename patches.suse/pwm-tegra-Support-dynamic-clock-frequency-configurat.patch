Subject: pwm: tegra: Support dynamic clock frequency configuration

Git-commit: 1d7796bdb63a63c9cc8087ffc6daeb36a7c005e1
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-15847

Added support for dynamic clock freq configuration in PWM kernel driver.
Earlier the PWM driver used to cache boot time clock rate by PWM clock
parent during probe. Hence dynamically changing PWM frequency was not
possible for all the possible ranges. With this change, dynamic
calculation is enabled and it is able to set the requested period from
sysfs knob provided the value is supported by clock source.

Changes mainly have 2 parts:
  - Tegra186 and later chips [1]
  - Tegra210 and prior chips [2]

For [1] - Changes implemented to set pwm period dynamically and also
          checks added to allow only if requested period(ns) is below or
          equals to higher range.

For [2] - Only checks if the requested period(ns) is below or equals to
          higher range defined by max clock limit. The limitation in
          Tegra210 or prior chips are due to the reason of having only
          one PWM controller supporting multiple channels. But later
          chips have multiple PWM controller instances each having
          single channel support.

+ * Overview of Tegra Pulse Width Modulator Register:
+ * 1. 13-bit: Frequency division (SCALE)
+ * 2. 8-bit : Pulse division (DUTY)
+ * 3. 1-bit : Enable bit
+ *
+ * The PWM clock frequency is divided by 256 before subdividing it based
+ * on the programmable frequency division value to generate the required
+ * frequency for PWM output. The maximum output frequency that can be
+ * achieved is (max rate of source clock) / 256.
+ * e.g. if source clock rate is 408 MHz, maximum output frequency can be:
+ * 408 MHz/256 = 1.6 MHz.
+ * This 1.6 MHz frequency can further be divided using SCALE value in PWM.
+ *
+ * PWM pulse width: 8 bits are usable [23:16] for varying pulse width.
+ * To achieve 100% duty cycle, program Bit [24] of this register to
+ * 1â€™b1. In which case the other bits [23:16] are set to don't care.
+ *
+ * Limitations:
+ * -	When PWM is disabled, the output is driven to inactive.
+ * -	It does not allow the current PWM period to complete and
+ *	stops abruptly.
+ *
+ * -	If the register is reconfigured while PWM is running,
+ *	it does not complete the currently running period.
+ *
+ * -	If the user input duty is beyond acceptible limits,
+ *	-EINVAL is returned.
