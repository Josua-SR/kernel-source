Subject: lp: fix sparc64 LPSETTIMEOUT ioctl
Git-commit: 45a2d64696b11913bcf1087b041740edbade3e21
Patch-mainline: 5.5-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.16

The layout of struct timeval is different on sparc64 from
anything else, and the patch I did long ago failed to take
this into account.

Change it now to handle sparc64 user space correctly again.

Quite likely nobody cares about parallel ports on sparc64,
but there is no reason not to fix it.
