Subject: drm/i915: Protect our local workers against I915_FENCE_TIMEOUT
Git-commit: 0f7dc62068bb2b929e213e759dba1eb038448a5c
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Trust our own workers to not cause unnecessary delays and disable the
automatic timeout on their asynchronous fence waits. (Along the same
lines that we trust our own requests to complete eventually, if
necessary by force.)
