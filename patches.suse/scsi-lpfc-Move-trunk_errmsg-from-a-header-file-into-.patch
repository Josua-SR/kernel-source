Subject: [PATCH] scsi: lpfc: Move trunk_errmsg[] from a header file into a .c
 file
References: bsc#1136217,jsc#SLE-4722
Git-commit: a73cb814923ab948fae64e34802cebe228228a88
Patch-mainline: v5.2-rc1

Arrays should be defined in .c files instead of in a header file. This
patch reduces the size of the lpfc kernel module.
