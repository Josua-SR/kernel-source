Subject: RDMA/srpt: Remove unnecessary assertion in srpt_queue_response
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
Git-commit: 9f48db0d4a08624bb9ba847ea40c8abad753b396
References: jsc#SLE-8449

Since ch has already been de-referenced by the time we get to the BUG_ON,
it is useless. The back trace alone is enough to tell what is going on,
delete the redundant BUG_ON.
