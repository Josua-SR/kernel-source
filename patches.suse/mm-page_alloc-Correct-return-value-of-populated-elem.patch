Subject: mm/page_alloc: Correct return value of populated elements if bulk
 array is populated
Git-commit: 66d9282523b3228183b14d9f812872dd2620704d
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: bsc#1187901

Dave Jones reported the following

	This made it into 5.13 final, and completely breaks NFSD for me
	(Serving tcp v3 mounts).  Existing mounts on clients hang, as do
	new mounts from new clients.  Rebooting the server back to rc7
	everything recovers.

The commit b3b64ebd3822 ("mm/page_alloc: do bulk array bounds check after
checking populated elements") returns the wrong value if the array is
already populated which is interpreted as an allocation failure. Dave
reported this fixes his problem and it also passed a test running dbench
over NFS.
