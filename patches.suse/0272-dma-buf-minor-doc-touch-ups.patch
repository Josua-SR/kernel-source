Subject: dma-buf: minor doc touch-ups
Git-commit: 102514ec73ed54b2681ff225e78e965e4fbe43ef
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Just some tiny edits:
- fix link to struct dma_fence
- give slightly more meaningful title - the polling here is about
  implicit fences, explicit fences (in sync_file or drm_syncobj) also
  have their own polling

v2: I misplaced the .rst include change corresponding to this patch.
