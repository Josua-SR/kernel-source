Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: stream: fix disable sequence
Git-commit: e0279b6b5522f86680a9e16a12dbb2e40b1e2698
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16518

When we disable the stream and then call hw_free, two bank switches
will be handled and as a result we re-enable the stream on hw_free.

Make sure the stream is disabled on both banks.

Todo: we need to completely revisit all this and make sure we have a
mirroring mechanism between current and alternate banks.
