Subject: [PATCH] ath: Map Bulgaria to ETSI1_WORLD
Git-commit: fed60f81a2d0839b2611929ab60b439e7d3d9714
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: FATE#326906

The regdomain code is used to select the correct the correct conformance
test limits (CTL) for a country. If the regdomain code isn't correctly
mapped to the actual CTL entries in EEPROM then it could happen that the
device violates the regulations. But it can also happen that the device is
then not able to be used with its full txpower on all rates.

This change itself doesn't change the selected CTL of this country and is
only required to stay in sync with the QCA mappings.
