Subject: [PATCH] net: team: fix memory leak in __team_options_register
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.15
Git-commit: 9a9e77495958c7382b2438bc19746dd3aaaabb8e

commit 9a9e77495958c7382b2438bc19746dd3aaaabb8e upstream.

The variable "i" isn't initialized back correctly after the first loop
under the label inst_rollback gets executed.

The value of "i" is assigned to be option_count - 1, and the ensuing
loop (under alloc_rollback) begins by initializing i--.
Thus, the value of i when the loop begins execution will now become
i = option_count - 2.

Thus, when kfree(dst_opts[i]) is called in the second loop in this
order, (i.e., inst_rollback followed by alloc_rollback),
dst_optsp[option_count - 2] is the first element freed, and
dst_opts[option_count - 1] does not get freed, and thus, a memory
leak is caused.

This memory leak can be fixed, by assigning i = option_count (instead of
option_count - 1).
