Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm283x: Use firmware PM driver for V3D
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.6
Git-commit: 3ac395a5b3f3b678663fbb58381fdae2b1b57588

[ Upstream commit 3ac395a5b3f3b678663fbb58381fdae2b1b57588 ]

The register based driver turned out to be unstable, specially on RPi3a+
but not limited to it. While a fix is being worked on, we roll back to
using firmware based scheme.
