Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: set correct vfs info for subflows
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.14
Git-commit: 7d14b0d2b9b317cfc14161143e2006b95a5da9b1

[ Upstream commit 7d14b0d2b9b317cfc14161143e2006b95a5da9b1 ]

When a subflow is created via mptcp_subflow_create_socket(),
a new 'struct socket' is allocated, with a new i_ino value.

When inspecting TCP sockets via the procfs and or the diag
interface, the above ones are not related to the process owning
the MPTCP master socket, even if they are a logical part of it
('ss -p' shows an empty process field)

Additionally, subflows created by the path manager get
the uid/gid from the running workqueue.

Subflows are part of the owning MPTCP master socket, let's
adjust the vfs info to reflect this.

After this patch, 'ss' correctly displays subflows as belonging
to the msk socket creator.
