Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Add mute LED and micmute LED support for
 HP systems
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.7
Git-commit: b2c22910fe5aae10b7e17b0721e63a3edf0c9553

commit b2c22910fe5aae10b7e17b0721e63a3edf0c9553 upstream.

There are two more HP systems control mute LED from HDA codec and need
to expose micmute led class so SoF can control micmute LED.

Add quirks to support them.
