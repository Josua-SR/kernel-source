Subject: [PATCH] opp: Enable resources again if they were disabled earlier
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.4
Git-commit: a4501bac0e553bed117b7e1b166d49731caf7260

commit a4501bac0e553bed117b7e1b166d49731caf7260 upstream.

dev_pm_opp_set_rate() can now be called with freq = 0 in order
to either drop performance or bandwidth votes or to disable
regulators on platforms which support them.

In such cases, a subsequent call to dev_pm_opp_set_rate() with
the same frequency ends up returning early because 'old_freq == freq'

Instead make it fall through and put back the dropped performance
and bandwidth votes and/or enable back the regulators.

Cc: v5.3+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v5.3+
Fixes: cd7ea582866f ("opp: Make dev_pm_opp_set_rate() handle freq = 0 to drop performance votes")
