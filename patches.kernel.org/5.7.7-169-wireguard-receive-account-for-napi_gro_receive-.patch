Subject: [PATCH] wireguard: receive: account for napi_gro_receive never
 returning GRO_DROP
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.7
Git-commit: df08126e3833e9dca19e2407db5f5860a7c194fb

[ Upstream commit df08126e3833e9dca19e2407db5f5860a7c194fb ]

The napi_gro_receive function no longer returns GRO_DROP ever, making
handling GRO_DROP dead code. This commit removes that dead code.
Further, it's not even clear that device drivers have any business in
taking action after passing off received packets; that's arguably out of
their hands.

Fixes: e7096c131e51 ("net: WireGuard secure network tunnel")
Fixes: 6570bc79c0df ("net: core: use listified Rx for GRO_NORMAL in napi_gro_receive()")
