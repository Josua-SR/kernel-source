Subject: [PATCH] rtw88: pci: Power cycle device during shutdown
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: 44492e70adc8086c42d3745d21d591657a427f04

[ Upstream commit 44492e70adc8086c42d3745d21d591657a427f04 ]

There are reports that 8822CE fails to work rtw88 with "failed to read DBI
register" error. Also I have a system with 8723DE which freezes the whole
system when the rtw88 is probing the device.

According to [1], platform firmware may not properly power manage the
device during shutdown. I did some expirements and putting the device to
D3 can workaround the issue.

So let's power cycle the device by putting the device to D3 at shutdown
to prevent the issue from happening.
