Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: Adding driver and quirk defs for multi-role LE
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 220915857e29795ae5ba4222806268b4a99c19c1

[ Upstream commit 220915857e29795ae5ba4222806268b4a99c19c1 ]

This change adds the relevant driver and quirk to allow drivers to
report the le_states as being trustworthy.

This has historically been disabled as controllers did not reliably
support this. In particular, this will be used to relax this condition
for controllers that have been well tested and reliable.

	/* Most controller will fail if we try to create new connections
	 * while we have an existing one in slave role.
	 */
	if (hdev->conn_hash.le_num_slave > 0)
		return NULL;
