Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Allow CPUs unffected by ARM erratum 1418040 to come in
 late
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.11
Git-commit: ed888cb0d1ebce69f12794e89fbd5e2c86d40b8d

[ Upstream commit ed888cb0d1ebce69f12794e89fbd5e2c86d40b8d ]

Now that we allow CPUs affected by erratum 1418040 to come in late,
this prevents their unaffected sibblings from coming in late (or
coming back after a suspend or hotplug-off, which amounts to the
same thing).

To allow this, we need to add ARM64_CPUCAP_OPTIONAL_FOR_LATE_CPU,
which amounts to set .type to ARM64_CPUCAP_WEAK_LOCAL_CPU_FEATURE.

Fixes: bf87bb0881d0 ("arm64: Allow booting of late CPUs affected by erratum 1418040")
