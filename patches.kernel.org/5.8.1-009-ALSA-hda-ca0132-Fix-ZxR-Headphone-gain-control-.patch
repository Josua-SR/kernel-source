Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Fix ZxR Headphone gain control get value.
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.1
Git-commit: a00dc409de455b64e6cb2f6d40cdb8237cdb2e83

commit a00dc409de455b64e6cb2f6d40cdb8237cdb2e83 upstream.

When the ZxR headphone gain control was added, the ca0132_switch_get
function was not updated, which meant that the changes to the control
state were not saved when entering/exiting alsamixer.
