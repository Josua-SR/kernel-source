Subject: [PATCH 3102/4917] cuse: prevent clone
Patch-mainline: 5.10.50
References: bsc#0000000
Git-commit: 2bfc47dec5b8b13b16dbab1a266ab9de387ca59b

[ Upstream commit 8217673d07256b22881127bf50dce874d0e51653 ]

For cloned connections cuse_channel_release() will be called more than
once, resulting in use after free.

Prevent device cloning for CUSE, which does not make sense at this point,
and highly unlikely to be used in real life.
