Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: improve comments about freeing data buffers whose page
 mapping is NULL
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.6
Git-commit: 780f66e59231fcf882f36c63f287252ee47cc75a

commit 780f66e59231fcf882f36c63f287252ee47cc75a upstream.

Improve comments in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() to describe why
we don't need to clear the buffer_mapped bit for freeing file mapping
buffers whose page mapping is NULL.
