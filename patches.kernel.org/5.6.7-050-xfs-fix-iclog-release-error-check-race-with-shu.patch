Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix iclog release error check race with shutdown
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.7
Git-commit: 6b789c337a5963ae57cbc7fe9e41488c40a9b014

[ Upstream commit 6b789c337a5963ae57cbc7fe9e41488c40a9b014 ]

Prior to commit df732b29c8 ("xfs: call xlog_state_release_iclog with
l_icloglock held"), xlog_state_release_iclog() always performed a
locked check of the iclog error state before proceeding into the
sync state processing code. As of this commit, part of
xlog_state_release_iclog() was open-coded into
xfs_log_release_iclog() and as a result the locked error state check
was lost.

The lockless check still exists, but this doesn't account for the
possibility of a race with a shutdown being performed by another
task causing the iclog state to change while the original task waits
on ->l_icloglock. This has reproduced very rarely via generic/475
and manifests as an assert failure in __xlog_state_release_iclog()
due to an unexpected iclog state.

Restore the locked error state check in xlog_state_release_iclog()
to ensure that an iclog state update via shutdown doesn't race with
the iclog release state processing code.

Fixes: df732b29c807 ("xfs: call xlog_state_release_iclog with l_icloglock held")
