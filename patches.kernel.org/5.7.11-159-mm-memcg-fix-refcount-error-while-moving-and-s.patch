Subject: [PATCH] mm/memcg: fix refcount error while moving and swapping
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.11
Git-commit: 8d22a9351035ef2ff12ef163a1091b8b8cf1e49c

commit 8d22a9351035ef2ff12ef163a1091b8b8cf1e49c upstream.

It was hard to keep a test running, moving tasks between memcgs with
move_charge_at_immigrate, while swapping: mem_cgroup_id_get_many()'s
refcount is discovered to be 0 (supposedly impossible), so it is then
forced to REFCOUNT_SATURATED, and after thousands of warnings in quick
succession, the test is at last put out of misery by being OOM killed.

This is because of the way moved_swap accounting was saved up until the
task move gets completed in __mem_cgroup_clear_mc(), deferred from when
mem_cgroup_move_swap_account() actually exchanged old and new ids.
Concurrent activity can free up swap quicker than the task is scanned,
bringing id refcount down 0 (which should only be possible when
offlining).

Just skip that optimization: do that part of the accounting immediately.

Fixes: 615d66c37c75 ("mm: memcontrol: fix memcg id ref counter on swap charge move")
