Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: meson: add missing g12 rng clock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.7
Git-commit: a1afbbb0285797e01313779c71287d936d069245

[ Upstream commit a1afbbb0285797e01313779c71287d936d069245 ]

This adds the missing perpheral clock for the RNG for Amlogic G12. As
stated in amlogic,meson-rng.yaml, this isn't always necessary for the
RNG to function, but is better to have in case the clock is disabled for
some reason prior to loading.
