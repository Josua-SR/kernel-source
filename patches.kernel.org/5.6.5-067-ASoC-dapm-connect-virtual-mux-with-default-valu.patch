Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dapm: connect virtual mux with default value
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.5
Git-commit: 3bbbb7728fc853d71dbce4073fef9f281fbfb4dd

commit 3bbbb7728fc853d71dbce4073fef9f281fbfb4dd upstream.

Since a virtual mixer has no backing registers
to decide which path to connect,
it will try to match with initial state.
This is to ensure that the default mixer choice will be
correctly powered up during initialization.
Invert flag is used to select initial state of the virtual switch.
Since actual hardware can't be disconnected by virtual switch,
connected is better choice as initial state in many cases.
