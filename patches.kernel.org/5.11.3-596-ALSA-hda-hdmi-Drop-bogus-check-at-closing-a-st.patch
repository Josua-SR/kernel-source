Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/hdmi: Drop bogus check at closing a stream
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 056a3da5d07fc5d3ceacfa2cdf013c9d8df630bd

commit 056a3da5d07fc5d3ceacfa2cdf013c9d8df630bd upstream.

Some users reported the kernel WARNING with stack traces from
hdmi_pcm_close(), and it's the line checking the per_cvt->assigned
flag.  This used to be a valid check in the past because the flag was
turned on/off only at opening and closing a PCM stream.  Meanwhile,
since the introduction of the silent-stream mode, this flag may be
turned on/off at the monitor connection/disconnection time, which
isn't always associated with the PCM open/close.  Hence this may lead
to the inconsistent per_cvt->assigned flag at closing.

As the check itself became almost useless and confuses users as if it
were a serious problem, just drop the check.
