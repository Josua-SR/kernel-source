Subject: [PATCH] hugetlbfs: fix anon huge page migration race
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.9
Git-commit: 336bf30eb76580b579dc711ded5d599d905c0217

commit 336bf30eb76580b579dc711ded5d599d905c0217 upstream.

Qian Cai reported the following BUG in [1]

  LTP: starting move_pages12
  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffffffffe0

Hugh Dickins diagnosed this as a migration bug caused by code introduced
to use i_mmap_rwsem for pmd sharing synchronization.  Specifically, the
routine unmap_and_move_huge_page() is always passing the TTU_RMAP_LOCKED
flag to try_to_unmap() while holding i_mmap_rwsem.  This is wrong for
anon pages as the anon_vma_lock should be held in this case.  Further
analysis suggested that i_mmap_rwsem was not required to he held at all
when calling try_to_unmap for anon pages as an anon page could never be
part of a shared pmd mapping.

Discussion also revealed that the hack in hugetlb_page_mapping_lock_write
to drop page lock and acquire i_mmap_rwsem is wrong.  There is no way to
keep mapping valid while dropping page lock.

This patch does the following:

 - Do not take i_mmap_rwsem and set TTU_RMAP_LOCKED for anon pages when
   calling try_to_unmap.

 - Remove the hacky code in hugetlb_page_mapping_lock_write. The routine
   will now simply do a 'trylock' while still holding the page lock. If
   the trylock fails, it will return NULL. This could impact the
   callers:

    - migration calling code will receive -EAGAIN and retry up to the
      hard coded limit (10).

    - memory error code will treat the page as BUSY. This will force
      killing (SIGKILL) instead of SIGBUS any mapping tasks.

   Do note that this change in behavior only happens when there is a
   race. None of the standard kernel testing suites actually hit this
   race, but it is possible.
