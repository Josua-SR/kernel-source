Subject: [PATCH] khugepaged: fix null-pointer dereference due to race
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.11
Git-commit: 594cced14ad3903166c8b091ff96adac7552f0b3

commit 594cced14ad3903166c8b091ff96adac7552f0b3 upstream.

khugepaged has to drop mmap lock several times while collapsing a page.
The situation can change while the lock is dropped and we need to
re-validate that the VMA is still in place and the PMD is still subject
for collapse.

But we miss one corner case: while collapsing an anonymous pages the VMA
could be replaced with file VMA.  If the file VMA doesn't have any
private pages we get NULL pointer dereference:

	general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN
	KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]
	anon_vma_lock_write include/linux/rmap.h:120 [inline]
	collapse_huge_page mm/khugepaged.c:1110 [inline]
	khugepaged_scan_pmd mm/khugepaged.c:1349 [inline]
	khugepaged_scan_mm_slot mm/khugepaged.c:2110 [inline]
	khugepaged_do_scan mm/khugepaged.c:2193 [inline]
	khugepaged+0x3bba/0x5a10 mm/khugepaged.c:2238

The fix is to make sure that the VMA is anonymous in
hugepage_vma_revalidate().  The helper is only used for collapsing
anonymous pages.
