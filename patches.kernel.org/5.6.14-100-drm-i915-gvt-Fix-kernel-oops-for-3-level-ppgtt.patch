Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/gvt: Fix kernel oops for 3-level ppgtt guest
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.14
Git-commit: 72a7a9925e2beea09b109dffb3384c9bf920d9da

[ Upstream commit 72a7a9925e2beea09b109dffb3384c9bf920d9da ]

As i915 won't allocate extra PDP for current default PML4 table,
so for 3-level ppgtt guest, we would hit kernel pointer access
failure on extra PDP pointers. So this trys to bypass that now.
It won't impact real shadow PPGTT setup, so guest context still
works.

This is verified on 4.15 guest kernel with i915.enable_ppgtt=1
to force on old aliasing ppgtt behavior.
