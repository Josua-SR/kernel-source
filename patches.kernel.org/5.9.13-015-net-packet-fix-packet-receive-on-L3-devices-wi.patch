Subject: [PATCH] net/packet: fix packet receive on L3 devices without visible
 hard header
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.13
Git-commit: d549699048b4b5c22dd710455bcdb76966e55aa3

[ Upstream commit d549699048b4b5c22dd710455bcdb76966e55aa3 ]

In the patchset merged by commit b9fcf0a0d826
("Merge branch 'support-AF_PACKET-for-layer-3-devices'") L3 devices which
did not have header_ops were given one for the purpose of protocol parsing
on af_packet transmit path.

That change made af_packet receive path regard these devices as having a
visible L3 header and therefore aligned incoming skb->data to point to the
skb's mac_header. Some devices, such as ipip, xfrmi, and others, do not
reset their mac_header prior to ingress and therefore their incoming
packets became malformed.

Ideally these devices would reset their mac headers, or af_packet would be
able to rely on dev->hard_header_len being 0 for such cases, but it seems
this is not the case.

Fix by changing af_packet RX ll visibility criteria to include the
existence of a '.create()' header operation, which is used when creating
a device hard header - via dev_hard_header() - by upper layers, and does
not exist in these L3 devices.

As this predicate may be useful in other situations, add it as a common
dev_has_header() helper in netdevice.h.

 /*
    Assumptions:
-   - if device has no dev->hard_header routine, it adds and removes ll header
-     inside itself. In this case ll header is invisible outside of device,
-     but higher levels still should reserve dev->hard_header_len.
-     Some devices are enough clever to reallocate skb, when header
-     will not fit to reserved space (tunnel), another ones are silly
-     (PPP).
+   - If the device has no dev->header_ops->create, there is no LL header
+     visible above the device. In this case, its hard_header_len should be 0.
+     The device may prepend its own header internally. In this case, its
+     needed_headroom should be set to the space needed for it to add its
+     internal header.
+     For example, a WiFi driver pretending to be an Ethernet driver should
+     set its hard_header_len to be the Ethernet header length, and set its
+     needed_headroom to be (the real WiFi header length - the fake Ethernet
+     header length).
    - packet socket receives packets with pulled ll header,
      so that SOCK_RAW should push it back.
 
 On receive:

-Incoming, dev->hard_header!=NULL

    data       -> data
 
-Outgoing, dev->hard_header!=NULL

    data       -> ll header
 
-Incoming, dev->hard_header==NULL
-   mac_header -> UNKNOWN position. It is very likely, that it points to ll
-		 header.  PPP makes it, that is wrong, because introduce
-		 assymetry between rx and tx paths.
+Incoming, dev_has_header(dev) == false
+   mac_header -> data
+     However drivers often make it point to the ll header.
+     This is incorrect because the ll header should be invisible to us.

-Outgoing, dev->hard_header==NULL
-   mac_header -> data. ll header is still not built!
+Outgoing, dev_has_header(dev) == false

    data       -> data
 
 Resume
-  If dev->hard_header==NULL we are unlikely to restore sensible ll header.
+  If dev_has_header(dev) == false we are unable to restore the ll header,
+    because it is invisible to us.
