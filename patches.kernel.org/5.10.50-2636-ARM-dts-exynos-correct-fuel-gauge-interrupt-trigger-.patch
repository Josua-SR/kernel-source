Subject: [PATCH 2636/4917] ARM: dts: exynos: correct fuel gauge interrupt
 trigger level on GT-I9100
Patch-mainline: 5.10.50
References: bsc#0000000
Git-commit: 41fdefb351ae4880f35ce356458a231835653fdc

[ Upstream commit 46799802136670e00498f19898f1635fbc85f583 ]

The Maxim fuel gauge datasheets describe the interrupt line as active
low with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  The falling edge
interrupt will mostly work but it's not correct.
