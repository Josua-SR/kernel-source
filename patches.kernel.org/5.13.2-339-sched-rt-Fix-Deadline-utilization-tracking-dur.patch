Subject: [PATCH] sched/rt: Fix Deadline utilization tracking during policy
 change
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: d7d607096ae6d378b4e92d49946d22739c047d4c

[ Upstream commit d7d607096ae6d378b4e92d49946d22739c047d4c ]

DL keeps track of the utilization on a per-rq basis with the structure
avg_dl. This utilization is updated during task_tick_dl(),
put_prev_task_dl() and set_next_task_dl(). However, when the current
running task changes its policy, set_next_task_dl() which would usually
take care of updating the utilization when the rq starts running DL
tasks, will not see a such change, leaving the avg_dl structure outdated.
When that very same task will be dequeued later, put_prev_task_dl() will
then update the utilization, based on a wrong last_update_time, leading to
a huge spike in the DL utilization signal.

The signal would eventually recover from this issue after few ms. Even
if no DL tasks are run, avg_dl is also updated in
__update_blocked_others(). But as the CPU capacity depends partly on the
avg_dl, this issue has nonetheless a significant impact on the scheduler.

Fix this issue by ensuring a load update when a running task changes
its policy to DL.
