Subject: [PATCH] um: falloc.h needs to be directly included for older libc
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.7
Git-commit: 35f3401317a3b26aa01fde8facfd320f2628fdcc

[ Upstream commit 35f3401317a3b26aa01fde8facfd320f2628fdcc ]

When building UML with glibc 2.17 installed, compilation
of arch/um/os-Linux/file.c fails due to failure to find
FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE and FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE definitions.

It appears that /usr/include/bits/fcntl-linux.h (indirectly
included by /usr/include/fcntl.h) does not include falloc.h
with an older glibc, whereas a more up-to-date version
does.

Adding the direct include to file.c resolves the issue
and does not cause problems for more recent glibc.

Fixes: 50109b5a03b4 ("um: Add support for DISCARD in the UBD Driver")
