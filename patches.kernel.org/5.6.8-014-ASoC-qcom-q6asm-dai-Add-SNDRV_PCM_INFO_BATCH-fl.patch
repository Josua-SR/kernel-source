Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: qcom: q6asm-dai: Add SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH flag
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.8
Git-commit: 7f2430cda819a9ecb1df5a0f3ef4f1c20db3f811

[ Upstream commit 7f2430cda819a9ecb1df5a0f3ef4f1c20db3f811 ]

At the moment, playing audio with PulseAudio with the qdsp6 driver
results in distorted sound. It seems like its timer-based scheduling
does not work properly with qdsp6 since setting tsched=0 in
the PulseAudio configuration avoids the issue.

Apparently this happens when the pointer() callback is not accurate
enough. There is a SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH flag that can be used to stop
PulseAudio from using timer-based scheduling by default.

According to https://www.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2014-March/073816.html:

    The flag is being used in the sense explained in the previous audio
    meeting -- the data transfer granularity isn't fine enough but aligned
    to the period size (or less).

q6asm-dai reports the position as multiple of

    prtd->pcm_count = snd_pcm_lib_period_bytes(substream)

so it indeed just a multiple of the period size.

Therefore adding the flag here seems appropriate and makes audio
work out of the box.
