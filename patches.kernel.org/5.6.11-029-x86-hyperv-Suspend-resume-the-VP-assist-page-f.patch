Subject: [PATCH] x86/hyperv: Suspend/resume the VP assist page for hibernation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.11
Git-commit: 421f090c819d695942a470051cd624dc43deaf95

commit 421f090c819d695942a470051cd624dc43deaf95 upstream.

Unlike the other CPUs, CPU0 is never offlined during hibernation, so in the
resume path, the "new" kernel's VP assist page is not suspended (i.e. not
disabled), and later when we jump to the "old" kernel, the page is not
properly re-enabled for CPU0 with the allocated page from the old kernel.

So far, the VP assist page is used by hv_apic_eoi_write(), and is also
used in the case of nested virtualization (running KVM atop Hyper-V).

For hv_apic_eoi_write(), when the page is not properly re-enabled,
hvp->apic_assist is always 0, so the HV_X64_MSR_EOI MSR is always written.
This is not ideal with respect to performance, but Hyper-V can still
correctly handle this according to the Hyper-V spec; nevertheless, Linux
still must update the Hyper-V hypervisor with the correct VP assist page
to prevent Hyper-V from writing to the stale page, which causes guest
memory corruption and consequently may have caused the hangs and triple
faults seen during non-boot CPUs resume.

Fix the issue by calling hv_cpu_die()/hv_cpu_init() in the syscore ops.
Without the fix, hibernation can fail at a rate of 1/300 ~ 1/500.
With the fix, hibernation can pass a long-haul test of 2000 runs.

In the case of nested virtualization, disabling/reenabling the assist
page upon hibernation may be unsafe if there are active L2 guests.
It looks KVM should be enhanced to abort the hibernation request if
there is any active L2 guest.
