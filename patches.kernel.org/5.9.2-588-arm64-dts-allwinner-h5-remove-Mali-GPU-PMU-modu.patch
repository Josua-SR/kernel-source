Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: allwinner: h5: remove Mali GPU PMU module
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: 2933bf3528007f834fb7f5eab033f9c5b0683f91

[ Upstream commit 2933bf3528007f834fb7f5eab033f9c5b0683f91 ]

H5's Mali GPU PMU is not present or working corretly although
H5 datasheet record its interrupt vector.

Adding this module will miss lead lima driver try to shutdown
it and get waiting timeout. This problem is not exposed before
lima runtime PM support is added.
