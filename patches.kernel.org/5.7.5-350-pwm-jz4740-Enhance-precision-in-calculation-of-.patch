Subject: [PATCH] pwm: jz4740: Enhance precision in calculation of duty cycle
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 9017dc4fbd59c09463019ce494cfe36d654495a8

commit 9017dc4fbd59c09463019ce494cfe36d654495a8 upstream.

Calculating the hardware value for the duty from the hardware value of
the period resulted in a precision loss versus calculating it from the
clock rate directly.

(Also remove a cast that doesn't really need to be here)
