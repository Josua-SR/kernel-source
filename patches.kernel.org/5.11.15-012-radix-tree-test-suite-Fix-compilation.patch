Subject: [PATCH] radix tree test suite: Fix compilation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.15
Git-commit: 7487de534dcbe143e6f41da751dd3ffcf93b00ee

[ Upstream commit 7487de534dcbe143e6f41da751dd3ffcf93b00ee ]

Commit 4bba4c4bb09a added tools/include/linux/compiler_types.h which
includes linux/compiler-gcc.h.  Unfortunately, we had our own (empty)
compiler_types.h which overrode the one added by that commit, and
so we lost the definition of __must_be_array().  Removing our empty
compiler_types.h fixes the problem and reduces our divergence from the
rest of the tools.
