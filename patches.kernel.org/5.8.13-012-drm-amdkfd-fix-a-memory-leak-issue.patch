Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdkfd: fix a memory leak issue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.13
Git-commit: 087d764159996ae378b08c0fdd557537adfd6899

[ Upstream commit 087d764159996ae378b08c0fdd557537adfd6899 ]

In the resume stage of GPU recovery, start_cpsch will call pm_init
which set pm->allocated as false, cause the next pm_release_ib has
no chance to release ib memory.

Add pm_release_ib in stop_cpsch which will be called in the suspend
stage of GPU recovery.
