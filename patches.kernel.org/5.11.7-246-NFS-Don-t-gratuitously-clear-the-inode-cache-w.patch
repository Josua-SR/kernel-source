Subject: [PATCH] NFS: Don't gratuitously clear the inode cache when lookup
 failed
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.7
Git-commit: 47397915ede0192235474b145ebcd81b37b03624

[ Upstream commit 47397915ede0192235474b145ebcd81b37b03624 ]

The fact that the lookup revalidation failed, does not mean that the
inode contents have changed.

Fixes: 5ceb9d7fdaaf ("NFS: Refactor nfs_lookup_revalidate()")
