Subject: [PATCH] misc: fastrpc: fix common struct sg_table related issues
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.5
Git-commit: 7cd7edb89437457ec36ffdbb970cc314d00c4aba

[ Upstream commit 7cd7edb89437457ec36ffdbb970cc314d00c4aba ]

The Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt states that the dma_map_sg() function
returns the number of the created entries in the DMA address space.
However the subsequent calls to the dma_sync_sg_for_{device,cpu}() and
dma_unmap_sg must be called with the original number of the entries
passed to the dma_map_sg().

struct sg_table is a common structure used for describing a non-contiguous
memory buffer, used commonly in the DRM and graphics subsystems. It
consists of a scatterlist with memory pages and DMA addresses (sgl entry),
as well as the number of scatterlist entries: CPU pages (orig_nents entry)
and DMA mapped pages (nents entry).

It turned out that it was a common mistake to misuse nents and orig_nents
entries, calling DMA-mapping functions with a wrong number of entries or
ignoring the number of mapped entries returned by the dma_map_sg()
function.

To avoid such issues, lets use a common dma-mapping wrappers operating
directly on the struct sg_table objects and use scatterlist page
iterators where possible. This, almost always, hides references to the
nents and orig_nents entries, making the code robust, easier to follow
and copy/paste safe.
