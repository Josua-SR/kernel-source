Subject: [PATCH] staging: ralink-gdma: fix kconfig dependency bug for
 DMA_RALINK
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.12
Git-commit: 06ea594051707c6b8834ef5b24e9b0730edd391b

[ Upstream commit 06ea594051707c6b8834ef5b24e9b0730edd391b ]

When DMA_RALINK is enabled and DMADEVICES is disabled, it results in the
following Kbuild warnings:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for DMA_ENGINE
  Depends on [n]: DMADEVICES [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - DMA_RALINK [=y] && STAGING [=y] && RALINK [=y] && !SOC_RT288X [=n]

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for DMA_VIRTUAL_CHANNELS
  Depends on [n]: DMADEVICES [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - DMA_RALINK [=y] && STAGING [=y] && RALINK [=y] && !SOC_RT288X [=n]

The reason is that DMA_RALINK selects DMA_ENGINE and DMA_VIRTUAL_CHANNELS
without depending on or selecting DMADEVICES while DMA_ENGINE and
DMA_VIRTUAL_CHANNELS are subordinate to DMADEVICES. This can also fail
building the kernel as demonstrated in a bug report.

Honor the kconfig dependency to remove unmet direct dependency warnings
and avoid any potential build failures.
