Subject: [PATCH] mm: initialize deferred pages with interrupts enabled
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 3d060856adfc59afb9d029c233141334cfaba418

commit 3d060856adfc59afb9d029c233141334cfaba418 upstream.

Initializing struct pages is a long task and keeping interrupts disabled
for the duration of this operation introduces a number of problems.

1. jiffies are not updated for long period of time, and thus incorrect time
   is reported. See proposed solution and discussion here:
   lkml/20200311123848.118638-1-shile.zhang@linux.alibaba.com
2. It prevents farther improving deferred page initialization by allowing
   intra-node multi-threading.

We are keeping interrupts disabled to solve a rather theoretical problem
that was never observed in real world (See 3a2d7fa8a3d5).

Let's keep interrupts enabled. In case we ever encounter a scenario where
an interrupt thread wants to allocate large amount of memory this early in
boot we can deal with that by growing zone (see deferred_grow_zone()) by
the needed amount before starting deferred_init_memmap() threads.

Before:
[    1.232459] node 0 initialised, 12058412 pages in 1ms

After:
[    1.632580] node 0 initialised, 12051227 pages in 436ms

Fixes: 3a2d7fa8a3d5 ("mm: disable interrupts while initializing deferred pages")
