Subject: [PATCH] iio: adc: ti-ads8344: Fix channel selection
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.15
Git-commit: bcfa1e253d2e329e1ebab5c89f3c73f6dd17606c

commit bcfa1e253d2e329e1ebab5c89f3c73f6dd17606c upstream.

During initial submission the selection of the channel was done using
the scan_index member of the iio_chan_spec structure. It was an abuse
because this member is supposed to be used with a buffer so it was
removed.

However there was still the need to be able to known how to select a
channel, the correct member to store this information is address.

Thanks to this it is possible to select any other channel than the
channel 0.
