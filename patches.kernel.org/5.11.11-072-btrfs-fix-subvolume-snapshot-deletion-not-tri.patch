Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix subvolume/snapshot deletion not triggered on mount
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.11
Git-commit: 8d488a8c7ba22d7112fbf6b0a82beb1cdea1c0d5

commit 8d488a8c7ba22d7112fbf6b0a82beb1cdea1c0d5 upstream.

During the mount procedure we are calling btrfs_orphan_cleanup() against
the root tree, which will find all orphans items in this tree. When an
orphan item corresponds to a deleted subvolume/snapshot (instead of an
inode space cache), it must not delete the orphan item, because that will
cause btrfs_find_orphan_roots() to not find the orphan item and therefore
not add the corresponding subvolume root to the list of dead roots, which
results in the subvolume's tree never being deleted by the cleanup thread.

The same applies to the remount from RO to RW path.

Fix this by making btrfs_find_orphan_roots() run before calling
btrfs_orphan_cleanup() against the root tree.

A test case for fstests will follow soon.
