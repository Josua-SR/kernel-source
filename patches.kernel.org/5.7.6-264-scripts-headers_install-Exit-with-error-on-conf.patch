Subject: [PATCH] scripts: headers_install: Exit with error on config leak
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.6
Git-commit: 5967577231f9b19acd5a59485e9075964065bbe3

[ Upstream commit 5967577231f9b19acd5a59485e9075964065bbe3 ]

Misuse of CONFIG_* in UAPI headers should result in an error. These config
options can be set in userspace by the user application which includes
these headers to control the APIs and structures being used in a kernel
which supports multiple targets.
