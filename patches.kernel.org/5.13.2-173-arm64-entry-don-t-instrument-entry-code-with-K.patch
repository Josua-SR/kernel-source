Subject: [PATCH] arm64: entry: don't instrument entry code with KCOV
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: bf6fa2c0dda751863c3446aa64d733013bec4a19

[ Upstream commit bf6fa2c0dda751863c3446aa64d733013bec4a19 ]

The code in entry-common.c runs at exception entry and return
boundaries, where portions of the kernel environment aren't available.
For example, RCU may not be watching, and lockdep state may be
out-of-sync with the hardware. Due to this, it is not sound to
instrument this code.

We generally avoid instrumentation by marking the entry functions as
`noinstr`, but currently this doesn't inhibit KCOV instrumentation.
Prevent this by disabling KCOV for the entire compilation unit.
