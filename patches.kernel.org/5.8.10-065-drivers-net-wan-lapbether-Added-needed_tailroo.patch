References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.10

[ Upstream commit 1ee39c1448c4e0d480c5b390e2db1987561fb5c2 ]

The underlying Ethernet device may request necessary tailroom to be
allocated by setting needed_tailroom. This driver should also set
needed_tailroom to request the tailroom needed by the underlying
Ethernet device to be allocated.
