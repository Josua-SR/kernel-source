Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Allow booting of late CPUs affected by erratum 1418040
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.6
Git-commit: bf87bb0881d0f59181fe3bbcf29c609f36483ff8

[ Upstream commit bf87bb0881d0f59181fe3bbcf29c609f36483ff8 ]

As we can now switch from a system that isn't affected by 1418040
to a system that globally is affected, let's allow affected CPUs
to come in at a later time.
