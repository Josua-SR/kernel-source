Subject: [PATCH] nfp: flower: fix ABI mismatch between driver and firmware
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.8
Git-commit: f614e536704d37326b0975da9cc33dd61d28c378

[ Upstream commit f614e536704d37326b0975da9cc33dd61d28c378 ]

Fix an issue where the driver wrongly detected ipv6 neighbour updates
from the NFP as corrupt. Add a reserved field on the kernel side so
it is similar to the ipv4 version of the struct and has space for the
extra bytes from the card.

Fixes: 9ea9bfa12240 ("nfp: flower: support ipv6 tunnel keep-alive messages from fw")
