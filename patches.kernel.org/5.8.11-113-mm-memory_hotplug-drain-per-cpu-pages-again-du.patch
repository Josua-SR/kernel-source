Subject: [PATCH] mm/memory_hotplug: drain per-cpu pages again during memory
 offline
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.11
Git-commit: 9683182612214aa5f5e709fad49444b847cd866a

commit 9683182612214aa5f5e709fad49444b847cd866a upstream.

There is a race during page offline that can lead to infinite loop:
a page never ends up on a buddy list and __offline_pages() keeps
retrying infinitely or until a termination signal is received.

Thread#1 - a new process:

load_elf_binary
 begin_new_exec
  exec_mmap
   mmput
    exit_mmap
     tlb_finish_mmu
      tlb_flush_mmu
       release_pages
        free_unref_page_list
         free_unref_page_prepare
          set_pcppage_migratetype(page, migratetype);
             // Set page->index migration type below  MIGRATE_PCPTYPES

Thread#2 - hot-removes memory
__offline_pages
  start_isolate_page_range
    set_migratetype_isolate
      set_pageblock_migratetype(page, MIGRATE_ISOLATE);
        Set migration type to MIGRATE_ISOLATE-> set
        drain_all_pages(zone);
             // drain per-cpu page lists to buddy allocator.

Thread#1 - continue
         free_unref_page_commit
           migratetype = get_pcppage_migratetype(page);
              // get old migration type
           list_add(&page->lru, &pcp->lists[migratetype]);
              // add new page to already drained pcp list

Thread#2
Never drains pcp again, and therefore gets stuck in the loop.

The fix is to try to drain per-cpu lists again after
check_pages_isolated_cb() fails.
