Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: s5pv210: add RTC 32 KHz clock in Aries family
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.5
Git-commit: 086c4498b0cc87fdb09188f3da7056e898814948

[ Upstream commit 086c4498b0cc87fdb09188f3da7056e898814948 ]

The S3C RTC requires 32768 Hz clock as input which is provided by PMIC.
However there is no such clock provider but rather a regulator driver
which registers the clock as a regulator.  This is an old driver which
will not be updated so add a workaround - a fixed-clock to fill missing
clock phandle reference in S3C RTC.

This fixes dtbs_check warnings:

  rtc@e2800000: clocks: [[2, 145]] is too short
  rtc@e2800000: clock-names: ['rtc'] is too short
