Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: always abort the transaction if we abort a trans
 handle
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 5963ffcaf383134985a5a2d8a4baa582d3999e0a

[ Upstream commit 5963ffcaf383134985a5a2d8a4baa582d3999e0a ]

While stress testing our error handling I noticed that sometimes we
would still commit the transaction even though we had aborted the
transaction.

Currently we track if a trans handle has dirtied any metadata, and if it
hasn't we mark the filesystem as having an error (so no new transactions
can be started), but we will allow the current transaction to complete
as we do not mark the transaction itself as having been aborted.

This sounds good in theory, but we were not properly tracking IO errors
in btrfs_finish_ordered_io, and thus committing the transaction with
bogus free space data.  This isn't necessarily a problem per-se with the
free space cache, as the other guards in place would have kept us from
accepting the free space cache as valid, but highlights a real world
case where we had a bug and could have corrupted the filesystem because
of it.

This "skip abort on empty trans handle" is nice in theory, but assumes
we have perfect error handling everywhere, which we clearly do not.
Also we do not allow further transactions to be started, so all this
does is save the last transaction that was happening, which doesn't
necessarily gain us anything other than the potential for real
corruption.

Remove this particular bit of code, if we decide we need to abort the
transaction then abort the current one and keep us from doing real harm
to the file system, regardless of whether this specific trans handle
dirtied anything or not.
