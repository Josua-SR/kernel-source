Subject: [PATCH] ext4: disable dioread_nolock whenever delayed allocation is
 disabled
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.13
Git-commit: c8980e1980ccdc2229aa2218d532ddc62e0aabe5

[ Upstream commit c8980e1980ccdc2229aa2218d532ddc62e0aabe5 ]

The patch "ext4: make dioread_nolock the default" (244adf6426ee) causes
generic/422 to fail when run in kvm-xfstests' ext3conv test case.  This
applies both the dioread_nolock and nodelalloc mount options, a
combination not previously tested by kvm-xfstests.  The failure occurs
because the dioread_nolock code path splits a previously fallocated
multiblock extent into a series of single block extents when overwriting
a portion of that extent.  That causes allocation of an extent tree leaf
node and a reshuffling of extents.  Once writeback is completed, the
individual extents are recombined into a single extent, the extent is
moved again, and the leaf node is deleted.  The difference in block
utilization before and after writeback due to the leaf node triggers the
failure.

The original reason for this behavior was to avoid ENOSPC when handling
I/O completions during writeback in the dioread_nolock code paths when
delayed allocation is disabled.  It may no longer be necessary, because
code was added in the past to reserve extra space to solve this problem
when delayed allocation is enabled, and this code may also apply when
delayed allocation is disabled.  Until this can be verified, don't use
the dioread_nolock code paths if delayed allocation is disabled.
