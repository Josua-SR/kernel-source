Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: NSP: Correct FA2 mailbox node
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.7
Git-commit: ac4e106d8934a5894811fc263f4b03fc8ed0fb7a

[ Upstream commit ac4e106d8934a5894811fc263f4b03fc8ed0fb7a ]

The FA2 mailbox is specified at 0x18025000 but should actually be
0x18025c00, length 0x400 according to socregs_nsp.h and board_bu.c. Also
the interrupt was off by one and should be GIC SPI 151 instead of 150.
