Subject: [PATCH] usb: typec: ucsi: acpi: Increase command completion timeout
 value
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.11
Git-commit: 130a96d698d7bee9f339832d1e47ab26aad8dbf1

commit 130a96d698d7bee9f339832d1e47ab26aad8dbf1 upstream.

UCSI specification quite clearly states that if a command
can't be completed in 10ms, the firmware must notify
about BUSY condition. Unfortunately almost none of the
platforms (the firmware on them) generate the BUSY
notification even if a command can't be completed in time.

The driver already considered that, and used a timeout
value of 5 seconds, but processing especially the alternate
mode discovery commands takes often considerable amount of
time from the firmware, much more than the 5 seconds. That
happens especially after bootup when devices are already
connected to the USB Type-C connector. For now on those
platforms the alternate mode discovery has simply failed
because of the timeout.

To improve the situation, increasing the timeout value for
the command completion to 1 minute. That should give enough
time for even the slowest firmware to process the commands.
