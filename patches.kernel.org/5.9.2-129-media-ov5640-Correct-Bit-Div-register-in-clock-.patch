Subject: [PATCH] media: ov5640: Correct Bit Div register in clock tree diagram
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: 4c85f628f6639e3e3e0a7788416154f28dfcae4f

[ Upstream commit 4c85f628f6639e3e3e0a7788416154f28dfcae4f ]

Although the code is correct and doing the right thing, the clock diagram
showed the wrong register for the bit divider, which had me doubting the
understanding of the tree. Fix this to avoid doubts in the future.
