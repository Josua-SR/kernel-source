Subject: [PATCH] i2c: core: Call i2c_acpi_install_space_handler() before
 i2c_acpi_register_devices()
Patch-mainline: 5.8.13
References: bsc#1012628 bsc#1176971
Git-commit: 21653a4181ff292480599dad996a2b759ccf050f

[ Upstream commit 21653a4181ff292480599dad996a2b759ccf050f ]

Some ACPI i2c-devices _STA method (which is used to detect if the device
is present) use autodetection code which probes which device is present
over i2c. This requires the I2C ACPI OpRegion handler to be registered
before we enumerate i2c-clients under the i2c-adapter.

This fixes the i2c touchpad on the Lenovo ThinkBook 14-IIL and
ThinkBook 15 IIL not getting an i2c-client instantiated and thus not
working.
