Subject: [PATCH] arm64/kernel: Fix range on invalidating dcache for boot page
 tables
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 9d2d75ede59bc1edd8561f2ee9d4702a5ea0ae30

[ Upstream commit 9d2d75ede59bc1edd8561f2ee9d4702a5ea0ae30 ]

Prior to commit 8eb7e28d4c642c31 ("arm64/mm: move runtime pgds to
rodata"), idmap_pgd_dir, tramp_pg_dir, reserved_ttbr0, swapper_pg_dir,
and init_pg_dir were contiguous at the end of the kernel image. The
maintenance at the end of __create_page_tables assumed these were
contiguous, and affected everything from the start of idmap_pg_dir
to the end of init_pg_dir.

That commit moved all but init_pg_dir into the .rodata section, with
other data placed between idmap_pg_dir and init_pg_dir, but did not
update the maintenance. Hence the maintenance is performed on much
more data than necessary (but as the bootloader previously made this
clean to the PoC there is no functional problem).

As we only alter idmap_pg_dir, and init_pg_dir, we only need to perform
maintenance for these. As the other dirs are in .rodata, the bootloader
will have initialised them as expected and cleaned them to the PoC. The
kernel will initialize them as necessary after enabling the MMU.

This patch reworks the maintenance to only cover the idmap_pg_dir and
init_pg_dir to avoid this unnecessary work.
