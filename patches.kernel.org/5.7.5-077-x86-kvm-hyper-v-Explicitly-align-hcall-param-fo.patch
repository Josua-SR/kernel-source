Subject: [PATCH] x86/kvm/hyper-v: Explicitly align hcall param for
 kvm_hyperv_exit
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: f7d31e65368aeef973fab788aa22c4f1d5a6af66

[ Upstream commit f7d31e65368aeef973fab788aa22c4f1d5a6af66 ]

The problem the patch is trying to address is the fact that 'struct
kvm_hyperv_exit' has different layout on when compiling in 32 and 64 bit
modes.

In 64-bit mode the default alignment boundary is 64 bits thus
forcing extra gaps after 'type' and 'msr' but in 32-bit mode the
boundary is at 32 bits thus no extra gaps.

This is an issue as even when the kernel is 64 bit, the userspace using
the interface can be both 32 and 64 bit but the same 32 bit userspace has
to work with 32 bit kernel.

The issue is fixed by forcing the 64 bit layout, this leads to ABI
change for 32 bit builds and while we are obviously breaking '32 bit
userspace with 32 bit kernel' case, we're fixing the '32 bit userspace
with 64 bit kernel' one.

As the interface has no (known) users and 32 bit KVM is rather baroque
nowadays, this seems like a reasonable decision.
