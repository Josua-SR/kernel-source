Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: mtk: Fix the probe error path
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 8a82bbcadec877f5f938c54026278dfc1f05a332

commit 8a82bbcadec877f5f938c54026278dfc1f05a332 upstream.

nand_release() is supposed be called after MTD device registration.
Here, only nand_scan() happened, so use nand_cleanup() instead.

There is no real Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
in this driver predates the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
which makes this change possible. However, pointing this commit as the
culprit for backporting purposes makes sense even if this commit is not
introducing any bug.
