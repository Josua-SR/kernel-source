Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: r8a7740: Add missing extal2 to CPG node
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.14
Git-commit: e47cb97f153193d4b41ca8d48127da14513d54c7

commit e47cb97f153193d4b41ca8d48127da14513d54c7 upstream.

The Clock Pulse Generator (CPG) device node lacks the extal2 clock.
This may lead to a failure registering the "r" clock, or to a wrong
parent for the "usb24s" clock, depending on MD_CK2 pin configuration and
boot loader CPG_USBCKCR register configuration.

This went unnoticed, as this does not affect the single upstream board
configuration, which relies on the first clock input only.
