Subject: [PATCH] Revert "PCI/PM: Assume ports without DLL Link Active train
 links in 100 ms"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.11
Git-commit: d08c30d7a0d1826f771f16cde32bd86e48401791

[ Upstream commit d08c30d7a0d1826f771f16cde32bd86e48401791 ]

This reverts commit ec411e02b7a2e785a4ed9ed283207cd14f48699d.

Patrick reported that this commit broke hybrid graphics on a ThinkPad X1
Extreme 2nd with Intel UHD Graphics 630 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Mobile:

  nouveau 0000:01:00.0: fifo: PBDMA0: 01000000 [] ch 0 [00ff992000 DRM] subc 0 mthd 0008 data 00000000

Karol reported that this commit broke Nouveau firmware loading on a Lenovo
P1G2 with Intel UHD Graphics 630 and NVIDIA TU117GLM [Quadro T1000 Mobile]:

  nouveau 0000:01:00.0: acr: AHESASC binary failed

In both cases, reverting ec411e02b7a2 solved the problem.  Unfortunately,
this revert will reintroduce the "Thunderbolt bridges take long time to
resume from D3cold" problem:
