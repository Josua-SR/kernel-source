Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: clearfog-gt-8k: fix switch link configuration
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.11
Git-commit: 7c6719a1aaca51ffd7cdf3905e70aa8313f6ef26

[ Upstream commit 7c6719a1aaca51ffd7cdf3905e70aa8313f6ef26 ]

The commit below caused a regression for clearfog-gt-8k, where the link
between the switch and the host does not come up.

Investigation revealed two issues:
- MV88E6xxx DSA no longer allows an in-band link to come up as the link
  is programmed to be forced down. Commit "net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix
  in-band AN link establishment" addresses this.

- The dts configured dissimilar link modes at each end of the host to
  switch link; the host was configured using a fixed link (so has no
  in-band status) and the switch was configured to expect in-band
  status.

With both issues fixed, the regression is resolved.

Fixes: 34b5e6a33c1a ("net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Configure MAC when using fixed link")
