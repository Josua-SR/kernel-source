Subject: [PATCH] Smack: Handle io_uring kernel thread privileges
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 942cb357ae7d9249088e3687ee6a00ed2745a0c7

[ Upstream commit 942cb357ae7d9249088e3687ee6a00ed2745a0c7 ]

Smack assumes that kernel threads are privileged for smackfs
operations. This was necessary because the credential of the
kernel thread was not related to a user operation. With io_uring
the credential does reflect a user's rights and can be used.
