[ Upstream commit 56098be85d19cd56b59d7b3854ea035cc8cb9e95 ]

BCM4908 has controller that needs different IRQ handling just like the
BCM63138. Describe it properly.

On Linux this change fixes:
brcmstb_nand ff801800.nand: timeout waiting for command 0x9
brcmstb_nand ff801800.nand: intfc status d0000000
