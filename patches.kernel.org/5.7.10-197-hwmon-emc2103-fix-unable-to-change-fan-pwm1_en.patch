Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (emc2103) fix unable to change fan pwm1_enable
 attribute
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.10
Git-commit: 14b0e83dc4f1e52b94acaeb85a18fd7fdd46d2dc

commit 14b0e83dc4f1e52b94acaeb85a18fd7fdd46d2dc upstream.

This patch fixes a bug which does not let FAN mode to be changed from
sysfs(pwm1_enable). i.e pwm1_enable can not be set to 3, it will always
remain at 0.

This is caused because the device driver handles the result of
"read_u8_from_i2c(client, REG_FAN_CONF1, &conf_reg)" incorrectly. The
driver thinks an error has occurred if the (result != 0). This has been
fixed by changing the condition to (result < 0).
