Subject: [PATCH] HID: lg-g15: Do not fail the probe when we fail to disable F#
 emulation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.6
Git-commit: b8a75eaddae9410767c7d95a1c5f3a547aae7b81

commit b8a75eaddae9410767c7d95a1c5f3a547aae7b81 upstream.

By default the G1-G12 keys on the Logitech gaming keyboards send
F1 - F12 when in "generic HID" mode.

The first thing the hid-lg-g15 driver does is disable this behavior.

We have received a bugreport that this does not work when the keyboard
is connected through an Aten KVM switch. Using a gaming keyboard with
a KVM is a bit weird setup, but still we can try to fail a bit more
gracefully here.

On the G510 keyboards the same USB-interface which is used for the gaming
keys is also used for the media-keys. Before this commit we would call
hid_hw_stop() on failure to disable the F# emulation and then exit the
probe method with an error code.

This not only causes us to not handle the gaming-keys, but this also
breaks the media keys which is a regression compared to the situation
when these keyboards where handled by the generic hidinput driver.

This commit changes the error handling to clear the hiddev drvdata
(to disable our .raw_event handler) and then returning from the probe
method with success.

The net result of this is that, when connected through a KVM, things
work as well as they did before the hid-lg-g15 driver was introduced.
