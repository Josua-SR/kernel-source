Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: increase F2 watermark for BCM4329
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.5
Git-commit: 317da69d10b0247c4042354eb90c75b81620ce9d

[ Upstream commit 317da69d10b0247c4042354eb90c75b81620ce9d ]

This patch fixes SDHCI CRC errors during of RX throughput testing on
BCM4329 chip if SDIO BUS is clocked above 25MHz. In particular the
checksum problem is observed on NVIDIA Tegra20 SoCs. The good watermark
value is borrowed from downstream BCMDHD driver and it's matching to the
value that is already used for the BCM4339 chip, hence let's re-use it
for BCM4329.
