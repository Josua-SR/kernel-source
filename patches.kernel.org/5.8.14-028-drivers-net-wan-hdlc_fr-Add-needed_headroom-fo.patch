Subject: [PATCH] drivers/net/wan/hdlc_fr: Add needed_headroom for PVC devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.14
Git-commit: 44a049c42681de71c783d75cd6e56b4e339488b0

[ Upstream commit 44a049c42681de71c783d75cd6e56b4e339488b0 ]

PVC devices are virtual devices in this driver stacked on top of the
actual HDLC device. They are the devices normal users would use.
PVC devices have two types: normal PVC devices and Ethernet-emulating
PVC devices.

When transmitting data with PVC devices, the ndo_start_xmit function
will prepend a header of 4 or 10 bytes. Currently this driver requests
this headroom to be reserved for normal PVC devices by setting their
hard_header_len to 10. However, this does not work when these devices
are used with AF_PACKET/RAW sockets. Also, this driver does not request
this headroom for Ethernet-emulating PVC devices (but deals with this
problem by reallocating the skb when needed, which is not optimal).

This patch replaces hard_header_len with needed_headroom, and set
needed_headroom for Ethernet-emulating PVC devices, too. This makes
the driver to request headroom for all PVC devices in all cases.
