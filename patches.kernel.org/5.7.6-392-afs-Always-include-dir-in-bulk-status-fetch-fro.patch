Subject: [PATCH] afs: Always include dir in bulk status fetch from
 afs_do_lookup()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.6
Git-commit: 13fcc6356a94558a0a4857dc00cd26b3834a1b3e

[ Upstream commit 13fcc6356a94558a0a4857dc00cd26b3834a1b3e ]

When a lookup is done in an AFS directory, the filesystem will speculate
and fetch up to 49 other statuses for files in the same directory and fetch
those as well, turning them into inodes or updating inodes that already
exist.

However, occasionally, a callback break might go missing due to NAT timing
out, but the afs filesystem doesn't then realise that the directory is not
up to date.

Alleviate this by using one of the status slots to check the directory in
which the lookup is being done.
