Subject: [PATCH] PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Fix PCIe bit conflicts
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.6
Git-commit: c88d19181771bd189147681ef38fc1533ebeff4c

[ Upstream commit c88d19181771bd189147681ef38fc1533ebeff4c ]

This patch fixes two bit conflicts in the pci-bridge-emul driver:

1. Bit 3 of Device Status (19 of Device Control) is marked as both
   Write-1-to-Clear and Read-Only. It should be Write-1-to-Clear.
   The Read-Only and Reserved bitmasks are shifted by 1 bit due to this
   error.

2. Bit 12 of Slot Control is marked as both Read-Write and Reserved.
   It should be Read-Write.
