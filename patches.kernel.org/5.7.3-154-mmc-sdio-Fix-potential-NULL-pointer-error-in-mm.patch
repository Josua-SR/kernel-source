Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdio: Fix potential NULL pointer error in
 mmc_sdio_init_card()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.3
Git-commit: f04086c225da11ad16d7f9a2fbca6483ab16dded

commit f04086c225da11ad16d7f9a2fbca6483ab16dded upstream.

During some scenarios mmc_sdio_init_card() runs a retry path for the UHS-I
specific initialization, which leads to removal of the previously allocated
card. A new card is then re-allocated while retrying.

However, in one of the corresponding error paths we may end up to remove an
already removed card, which likely leads to a NULL pointer exception. So,
let's fix this.

Fixes: 5fc3d80ef496 ("mmc: sdio: don't use rocr to check if the card could support UHS mode")
