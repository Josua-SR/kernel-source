Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - fix the micmute led status for Lenovo ThinkCentre
 AIO
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.2
Git-commit: 386a6539992b82fe9ac4f9dc3f548956fd894d8c

commit 386a6539992b82fe9ac4f9dc3f548956fd894d8c upstream.

After installing the Ubuntu Linux, the micmute led status is not
correct. Users expect that the led is on if the capture is disabled,
but with the current kernel, the led is off with the capture disabled.

We tried the old linux kernel like linux-4.15, there is no this issue.
It looks like we introduced this issue when switching to the led_cdev.
