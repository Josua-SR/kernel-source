Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6q-prti6q: fix PHY address
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.11
Git-commit: e402599e5e5e0b2758d7766fd9f6d7953d4ccd85

[ Upstream commit e402599e5e5e0b2758d7766fd9f6d7953d4ccd85 ]

Due to bug in the bootloader, the PHY has floating address and may
randomly change on each PHY reset. To avoid it, the updated bootloader
with the following patch[0] should be used:

| ARM: protonic: disable on-die termination to fix PHY bootstrapping
|
| If on-die termination is enabled, the RXC pin of iMX6 will be pulled
| high. Since we already have an 10K pull-down on board, the RXC level on
| PHY reset will be ~800mV, which is mostly interpreted as 1. On some
| reboots we get 0 instead and kernel can't detect the PHY properly.
|
| Since the default 0x020e07ac value is 0, it is sufficient to remove this
| entry from the affected imxcfg files.
|
| Since we get stable 0 on pin PHYADDR[2], the PHY address is changed from
| 4 to 0.

With latest bootloader update, the PHY address will be fixed to "0".
