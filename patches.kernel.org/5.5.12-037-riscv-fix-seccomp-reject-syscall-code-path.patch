Subject: [PATCH] riscv: fix seccomp reject syscall code path
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.12
Git-commit: af33d2433b03d63ed31fcfda842f46676a5e1afc

[ Upstream commit af33d2433b03d63ed31fcfda842f46676a5e1afc ]

If secure_computing() rejected a system call, we were previously setting
the system call number to -1, to indicate to later code that the syscall
failed. However, if something (e.g. a user notification) was sleeping, and
received a signal, we may set a0 to -ERESTARTSYS and re-try the system call
again.

In this case, seccomp "denies" the syscall (because of the signal), and we
would set a7 to -1, thus losing the value of the system call we want to
restart.

Instead, let's return -1 from do_syscall_trace_enter() to indicate that the
syscall was rejected, so we don't clobber the value in case of -ERESTARTSYS
or whatever.

This commit fixes the user_notification_signal seccomp selftest on riscv to
no longer hang. That test expects the system call to be re-issued after the
signal, and it wasn't due to the above bug. Now that it is, everything
works normally.

Note that in the ptrace (tracer) case, the tracer can set the register
values to whatever they want, so we still need to keep the code that
handles out-of-bounds syscalls. However, we can drop the comment.

We can also drop syscall_set_nr(), since it is no longer used anywhere, and
the code that re-loads the value in a7 because of it.
