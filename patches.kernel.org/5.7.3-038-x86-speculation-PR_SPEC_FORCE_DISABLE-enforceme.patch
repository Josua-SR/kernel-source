Subject: [PATCH] x86/speculation: PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE enforcement for
 indirect branches.
Patch-mainline: 5.7.3
References: CVE-2020-10768 bnc#1012628 bsc#1172783
Git-commit: 4d8df8cbb9156b0a0ab3f802b80cb5db57acc0bf

commit 4d8df8cbb9156b0a0ab3f802b80cb5db57acc0bf upstream.

Currently, it is possible to enable indirect branch speculation even after
it was force-disabled using the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE option. Moreover, the
PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL command gives afterwards an incorrect result
(force-disabled when it is in fact enabled). This also is inconsistent
vs. STIBP and the documention which cleary states that
PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE cannot be undone.

Fix this by actually enforcing force-disabled indirect branch
speculation. PR_SPEC_ENABLE called after PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE now fails
with -EPERM as described in the documentation.
