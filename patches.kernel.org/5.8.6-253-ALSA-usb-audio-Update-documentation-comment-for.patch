Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Update documentation comment for MS2109
 quirk
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.6
Git-commit: 74a2a7de81a2ef20732ec02087314e92692a7a1b

commit 74a2a7de81a2ef20732ec02087314e92692a7a1b upstream.

As the recent fix addressed the channel swap problem more properly,
update the comment as well.
