Subject: [PATCH] locking/lockdep: Reduce LOCKDEP dependency list
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: b8e00abe7d9fe21dd13609e2e3a707e38902b105

[ Upstream commit b8e00abe7d9fe21dd13609e2e3a707e38902b105 ]

Some arches (um, sparc64, riscv, xtensa) cause a Kconfig warning for
LOCKDEP.
These arch-es select LOCKDEP_SUPPORT but they are not listed as one
of the arch-es that LOCKDEP depends on.

Since (16) arch-es define the Kconfig symbol LOCKDEP_SUPPORT if they
intend to have LOCKDEP support, replace the awkward list of
arch-es that LOCKDEP depends on with the LOCKDEP_SUPPORT symbol.

But wait. LOCKDEP_SUPPORT is included in LOCK_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT,
which is already a dependency here, so LOCKDEP_SUPPORT is redundant
and not needed.
That leaves the FRAME_POINTER dependency, but it is part of an
expression like this:
	depends on (A && B) && (FRAME_POINTER || B')
where B' is a dependency of B so if B is true then B' is true
and the value of FRAME_POINTER does not matter.
Thus we can also delete the FRAME_POINTER dependency.

Fixes this kconfig warning: (for um, sparc64, riscv, xtensa)

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for LOCKDEP
  Depends on [n]: DEBUG_KERNEL [=y] && LOCK_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT [=y] && (FRAME_POINTER [=n] || MIPS || PPC || S390 || MICROBLAZE || ARM || ARC || X86)
  Selected by [y]:
  - PROVE_LOCKING [=y] && DEBUG_KERNEL [=y] && LOCK_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT [=y]
  - LOCK_STAT [=y] && DEBUG_KERNEL [=y] && LOCK_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT [=y]
  - DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC [=y] && DEBUG_KERNEL [=y] && LOCK_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT [=y]
