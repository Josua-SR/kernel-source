Subject: [PATCH] dm integrity: select CRYPTO_SKCIPHER
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.11
Git-commit: f7b347acb5f6c29d9229bb64893d8b6a2c7949fb

[ Upstream commit f7b347acb5f6c29d9229bb64893d8b6a2c7949fb ]

The integrity target relies on skcipher for encryption/decryption, but
certain kernel configurations may not enable CRYPTO_SKCIPHER, leading to
compilation errors due to unresolved symbols. Explicitly select
CRYPTO_SKCIPHER for DM_INTEGRITY, since it is unconditionally dependent
on it.
