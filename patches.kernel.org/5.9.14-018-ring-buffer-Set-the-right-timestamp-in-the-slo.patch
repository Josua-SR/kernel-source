Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Set the right timestamp in the slow path of
 __rb_reserve_next()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.14
Git-commit: 8785f51a17083eee7c37606079c6447afc6ba102

commit 8785f51a17083eee7c37606079c6447afc6ba102 upstream.

In the slow path of __rb_reserve_next() a nested event(s) can happen
between evaluating the timestamp delta of the current event and updating
write_stamp via local_cmpxchg(); in this case the delta is not valid
anymore and it should be set to 0 (same timestamp as the interrupting
event), since the event that we are currently processing is not the last
event in the buffer.
