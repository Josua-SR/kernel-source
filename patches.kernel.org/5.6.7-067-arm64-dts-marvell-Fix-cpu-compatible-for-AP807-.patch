Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: marvell: Fix cpu compatible for AP807-quad
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.7
Git-commit: d136d2588b21b1a07515632ed61120c9f262909b

[ Upstream commit d136d2588b21b1a07515632ed61120c9f262909b ]

make -k ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check shows the following errors. Fix them by
removing the "arm,armv8" compatible.
