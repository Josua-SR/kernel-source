Subject: [PATCH] iomap: Mark read blocks uptodate in write_begin
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: 14284fedf59f1647264f4603d64418cf1fcd3eb0

[ Upstream commit 14284fedf59f1647264f4603d64418cf1fcd3eb0 ]

When bringing (portions of) a page uptodate, we were marking blocks that
were zeroed as being uptodate, but not blocks that were read from storage.

Like the previous commit, this problem was found with generic/127 and
a kernel which failed readahead I/Os.  This bug causes writes to be
silently lost when working with flaky storage.

Fixes: 9dc55f1389f9 ("iomap: add support for sub-pagesize buffered I/O without buffer heads")
