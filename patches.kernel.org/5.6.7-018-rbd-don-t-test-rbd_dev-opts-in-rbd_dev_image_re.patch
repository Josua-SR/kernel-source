Subject: [PATCH] rbd: don't test rbd_dev->opts in rbd_dev_image_release()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.7
Git-commit: b8776051529230f76e464d5ffc5d1cf8465576bf

commit b8776051529230f76e464d5ffc5d1cf8465576bf upstream.

rbd_dev->opts is used to distinguish between the image that is being
mapped and a parent.  However, because we no longer establish watch for
read-only mappings, this test is imprecise and results in unnecessary
rbd_unregister_watch() calls.

Make it consistent with need_watch in rbd_dev_image_probe().
