Subject: [PATCH] net/bpfilter: remove superfluous testing message
Patch-mainline: 5.6.6
References: bnc#1012628 bnc#1168664
Git-commit: 41c55ea6c2a7ca4c663eeec05bdf54f4e2419699

commit 41c55ea6c2a7ca4c663eeec05bdf54f4e2419699 upstream.

A testing message was brought by 13d0f7b814d9 ("net/bpfilter: fix dprintf
usage for /dev/kmsg") but should've been deleted before patch submission.
Although it doesn't cause any harm to the code or functionality itself, it's
totally unpleasant to have it displayed on every loop iteration with no real
use case. Thus remove it unconditionally.

Fixes: 13d0f7b814d9 ("net/bpfilter: fix dprintf usage for /dev/kmsg")
