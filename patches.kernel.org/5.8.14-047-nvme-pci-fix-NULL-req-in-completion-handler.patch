Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: fix NULL req in completion handler
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.14
Git-commit: 50b7c24390a53c78de546215282fb52980f1d7b7

[ Upstream commit 50b7c24390a53c78de546215282fb52980f1d7b7 ]

Currently, we use nvmeq->q_depth as the upper limit for a valid tag in
nvme_handle_cqe(), it is not correct. Because the available tag number
is recorded in tagset, which is not equal to nvmeq->q_depth.

The nvme driver registers interrupts for queues before initializing the
tagset, because it uses the number of successful request_irq() calls to
configure the tagset parameters. This allows a race condition with the
current tag validity check if the controller happens to produce an
interrupt with a corrupted CQE before the tagset is initialized.

Replace the driver's indirect tag check with the one already provided by
the block layer.
