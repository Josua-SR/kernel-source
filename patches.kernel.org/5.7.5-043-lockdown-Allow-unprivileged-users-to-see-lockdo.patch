Subject: [PATCH] lockdown: Allow unprivileged users to see lockdown status
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 60cf7c5ed5f7087c4de87a7676b8c82d96fd166c

[ Upstream commit 60cf7c5ed5f7087c4de87a7676b8c82d96fd166c ]

A number of userspace tools, such as systemtap, need a way to see the
current lockdown state so they can gracefully deal with the kernel being
locked down. The state is already exposed in
/sys/kernel/security/lockdown, but is only readable by root. Adjust the
permissions so unprivileged users can read the state.
