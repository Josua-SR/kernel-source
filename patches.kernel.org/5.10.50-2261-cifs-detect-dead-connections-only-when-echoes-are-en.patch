Subject: [PATCH 2261/4917] cifs: detect dead connections only when echoes are
 enabled.
Patch-mainline: 5.10.50
References: bsc#0000000
Git-commit: 8a90058752e0b04b3159fa889a7f611b550bf816

commit f4916649f98e2c7bdba38c6597a98c456c17317d upstream.

We can detect server unresponsiveness only if echoes are enabled.
Echoes can be disabled under two scenarios:
1. The connection is low on credits, so we've disabled echoes/oplocks.
2. The connection has not seen any request till now (other than
negotiate/sess-setup), which is when we enable these two, based on
the credits available.

So this fix will check for dead connection, only when echo is enabled.
