Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm283x: Add cells encoding format to firmware bus
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.9
Git-commit: be08d278eb09210fefbad4c9b27d7843f1c096b2

commit be08d278eb09210fefbad4c9b27d7843f1c096b2 upstream.

With the introduction of 55c7c0621078 ("ARM: dts: bcm283x: Fix vc4's
firmware bus DMA limitations") the firmware bus has to comply with
/soc's DMA limitations. Ultimately linking both buses to a same
dma-ranges property. The patch (and author) missed the fact that a bus'
#address-cells and #size-cells properties are not inherited, but set to
a fixed value which, in this case, doesn't match /soc's. This, although
not breaking Linux's DMA mapping functionality, generates ugly dtc
warnings.

Fix the issue by adding the correct address and size cells properties
under the firmware bus.
