Subject: [PATCH] opp: Don't drop extra references to OPPs accidentally
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.7
Git-commit: 606a5d4227e4610399c61086ac55c46068a90b03

commit 606a5d4227e4610399c61086ac55c46068a90b03 upstream.

We are required to call dev_pm_opp_put() from outside of the
opp_table->lock as debugfs removal needs to happen lock-less to avoid
circular dependency issues.

commit cf1fac943c63 ("opp: Reduce the size of critical section in
_opp_kref_release()") tried to fix that introducing a new routine
_opp_get_next() which keeps returning OPPs that can be freed by the
callers and this routine shall be called without holding the
opp_table->lock.

Though the commit overlooked the fact that the OPPs can be referenced by
other users as well and this routine will end up dropping references
which were taken by other users and hence freeing the OPPs prematurely.

In effect, other users of the OPPs will end up having invalid pointers
at hand. We didn't see any crash reports earlier as the exact situation
never happened, though it is certainly possible.

We need a way to mark which OPPs are no longer referenced by the OPP
core, so we don't drop extra references to them accidentally.

This commit adds another OPP flag, "removed", which is used to track
this. And now we should never end up dropping extra references to the
OPPs.
