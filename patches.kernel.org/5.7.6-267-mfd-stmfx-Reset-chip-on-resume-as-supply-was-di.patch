Subject: [PATCH] mfd: stmfx: Reset chip on resume as supply was disabled
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.6
Git-commit: e583649d87ec090444aa5347af0927cd6e8581ae

[ Upstream commit e583649d87ec090444aa5347af0927cd6e8581ae ]

STMFX supply is disabled during suspend. To avoid a too early access to
the STMFX firmware on resume, reset the chip and wait for its firmware to
be loaded.
