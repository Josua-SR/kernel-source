Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s: handle ISA v3.1 local copy-paste context
 switches
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.5
Git-commit: dc462267d2d7aacffc3c1d99b02d7a7c59db7c66

[ Upstream commit dc462267d2d7aacffc3c1d99b02d7a7c59db7c66 ]

The ISA v3.1 the copy-paste facility has a new memory move functionality
which allows the copy buffer to be pasted to domestic memory (RAM) as
opposed to foreign memory (accelerator).

This means the POWER9 trick of avoiding the cp_abort on context switch if
the process had not mapped foreign memory does not work on POWER10. Do the
cp_abort unconditionally there.

KVM must also cp_abort on guest exit to prevent copy buffer state leaking
between contexts.
