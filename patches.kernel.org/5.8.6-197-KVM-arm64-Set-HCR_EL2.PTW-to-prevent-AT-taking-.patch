Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Set HCR_EL2.PTW to prevent AT taking synchronous
 exception
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.6
Git-commit: 71a7f8cb1ca4ca7214a700b1243626759b6c11d4

commit 71a7f8cb1ca4ca7214a700b1243626759b6c11d4 upstream.

AT instructions do a translation table walk and return the result, or
the fault in PAR_EL1. KVM uses these to find the IPA when the value is
not provided by the CPU in HPFAR_EL1.

If a translation table walk causes an external abort it is taken as an
exception, even if it was due to an AT instruction. (DDI0487F.a's D5.2.11
"Synchronous faults generated by address translation instructions")

While we previously made KVM resilient to exceptions taken due to AT
instructions, the device access causes mismatched attributes, and may
occur speculatively. Prevent this, by forbidding a walk through memory
described as device at stage2. Now such AT instructions will report a
stage2 fault.

Such a fault will cause KVM to restart the guest. If the AT instructions
always walk the page tables, but guest execution uses the translation cached
in the TLB, the guest can't make forward progress until the TLB entry is
evicted. This isn't a problem, as since commit 5dcd0fdbb492 ("KVM: arm64:
Defer guest entry when an asynchronous exception is pending"), KVM will
return to the host to process IRQs allowing the rest of the system to keep
running.
