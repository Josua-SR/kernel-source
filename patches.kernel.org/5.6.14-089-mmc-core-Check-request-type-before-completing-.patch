Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: Check request type before completing the request
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.14
Git-commit: e6bfb1bf00852b55f4c771f47ae67004c04d3c87

[ Upstream commit e6bfb1bf00852b55f4c771f47ae67004c04d3c87 ]

In the request completion path with CQE, request type is being checked
after the request is getting completed. This is resulting in returning
the wrong request type and leading to the IO hang issue.

ASYNC request type is getting returned for DCMD type requests.
Because of this mismatch, mq->cqe_busy flag is never getting cleared
and the driver is not invoking blk_mq_hw_run_queue. So requests are not
getting dispatched to the LLD from the block layer.

All these eventually leading to IO hang issues.
So, get the request type before completing the request.
