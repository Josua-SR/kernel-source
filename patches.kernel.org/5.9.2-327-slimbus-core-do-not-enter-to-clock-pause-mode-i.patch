Subject: [PATCH] slimbus: core: do not enter to clock pause mode in core
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: df2c471c4ae07e18a0396db670dca2ef867c5153

[ Upstream commit df2c471c4ae07e18a0396db670dca2ef867c5153 ]

Let the controller logic decide when to enter into clock pause mode!
Entering in to pause mode during unregistration does not really make
sense as the controller is totally going down at that point in time.
