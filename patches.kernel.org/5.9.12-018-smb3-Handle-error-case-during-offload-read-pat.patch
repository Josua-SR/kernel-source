Subject: [PATCH] smb3: Handle error case during offload read path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.12
Git-commit: 1254100030b3377e8302f9c75090ab191d73ee7c

commit 1254100030b3377e8302f9c75090ab191d73ee7c upstream.

Mid callback needs to be called only when valid data is
read into pages.

These patches address a problem found during decryption offload:
      CIFS: VFS: trying to dequeue a deleted mid
that could cause a refcount use after free:
      Workqueue: smb3decryptd smb2_decrypt_offload [cifs]
