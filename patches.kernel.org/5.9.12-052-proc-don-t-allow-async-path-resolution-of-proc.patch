Subject: [PATCH] proc: don't allow async path resolution of /proc/self
 components
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.12
Git-commit: 8d4c3e76e3be11a64df95ddee52e99092d42fc19

[ Upstream commit 8d4c3e76e3be11a64df95ddee52e99092d42fc19 ]

If this is attempted by a kthread, then return -EOPNOTSUPP as we don't
currently support that. Once we can get task_pid_ptr() doing the right
thing, then this can go away again.
