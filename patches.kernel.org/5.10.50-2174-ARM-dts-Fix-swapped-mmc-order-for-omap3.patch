Subject: [PATCH 2174/4917] ARM: dts: Fix swapped mmc order for omap3
Patch-mainline: 5.10.50
References: bsc#0000000
Git-commit: 6ce64437224df9f28bb4bc17a4b5363560dcc79a

[ Upstream commit a1ebdb3741993f853865d1bd8f77881916ad53a7 ]

Also some omap3 devices like n900 seem to have eMMC and micro-sd swapped
around with commit 21b2cec61c04 ("mmc: Set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS for
drivers that existed in v4.4").

Let's fix the issue with aliases as discussed on the mailing lists. While
the mmc aliases should be board specific, let's first fix the issue with
minimal changes.
