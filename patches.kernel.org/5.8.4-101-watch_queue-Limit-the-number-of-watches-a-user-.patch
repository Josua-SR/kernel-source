Subject: [PATCH] watch_queue: Limit the number of watches a user can hold
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.4
Git-commit: 29e44f4535faa71a70827af3639b5e6762d8f02a

[ Upstream commit 29e44f4535faa71a70827af3639b5e6762d8f02a ]

Impose a limit on the number of watches that a user can hold so that
they can't use this mechanism to fill up all the available memory.

This is done by putting a counter in user_struct that's incremented when
a watch is allocated and decreased when it is released.  If the number
exceeds the RLIMIT_NOFILE limit, the watch is rejected with EAGAIN.

This can be tested by the following means:

 (1) Create a watch queue and attach it to fd 5 in the program given - in
     this case, bash:

	keyctl watch_session /tmp/nlog /tmp/gclog 5 bash

 (2) In the shell, set the maximum number of files to, say, 99:

	ulimit -n 99

 (3) Add 200 keyrings:

	for ((i=0; i<200; i++)); do keyctl newring a$i @s || break; done

 (4) Try to watch all of the keyrings:

	for ((i=0; i<200; i++)); do echo $i; keyctl watch_add 5 %:a$i || break; done

     This should fail when the number of watches belonging to the user hits
     99.

 (5) Remove all the keyrings and all of those watches should go away:

	for ((i=0; i<200; i++)); do keyctl unlink %:a$i; done

 (6) Kill off the watch queue by exiting the shell spawned by
     watch_session.
