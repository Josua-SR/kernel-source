Subject: [PATCH] i2c: designware: slave should do WRITE_REQUESTED before
 WRITE_RECEIVED
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.9
Git-commit: 3b5f7f10ff6e6b66f553e12cc50d9bb751ce60ad

[ Upstream commit 3b5f7f10ff6e6b66f553e12cc50d9bb751ce60ad ]

Sometimes we would get the following flow when doing an i2cset:

0x1 STATUS SLAVE_ACTIVITY=0x1 : RAW_INTR_STAT=0x514 : INTR_STAT=0x4
I2C_SLAVE_WRITE_RECEIVED
0x1 STATUS SLAVE_ACTIVITY=0x0 : RAW_INTR_STAT=0x714 : INTR_STAT=0x204
I2C_SLAVE_WRITE_REQUESTED
I2C_SLAVE_WRITE_RECEIVED

Documentation/i2c/slave-interface.rst says that I2C_SLAVE_WRITE_REQUESTED,
which is mandatory, should be sent while the data did not arrive yet. It
means in a write-request I2C_SLAVE_WRITE_REQUESTED should be reported
before any I2C_SLAVE_WRITE_RECEIVED.

By the way, I2C_SLAVE_STOP didn't be reported in the above case because
DW_IC_INTR_STAT was not 0x200.

dev->status can be used to record the current state, especially Designware
I2C controller has no interrupts to identify a write-request. This patch
makes not only I2C_SLAVE_WRITE_REQUESTED been reported first when
IC_INTR_RX_FULL is rising and dev->status isn't STATUS_WRITE_IN_PROGRESS
but also I2C_SLAVE_STOP been reported when a STOP condition is received.
