Subject: [PATCH] nvme: fix identify error status silent ignore
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.8
Git-commit: ea43d9709f727e728e933a8157a7a7ca1a868281

[ Upstream commit ea43d9709f727e728e933a8157a7a7ca1a868281 ]

Commit 59c7c3caaaf8 intended to only silently ignore non retry-able
errors (DNR bit set) such that we can still identify misbehaving
controllers, and in the other hand propagate retry-able errors (DNR bit
cleared) so we don't wrongly abandon a namespace just because it happens
to be temporarily inaccessible.

The goal remains the same as the original commit where this was
introduced but unfortunately had the logic backwards.

Fixes: 59c7c3caaaf8 ("nvme: fix possible hang when ns scanning fails during error recovery")
