Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx8mq-librem5-r3: Mark buck3 as always on
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: a362b0cc94d476b097ba0ff466958c1d4e27e219

[ Upstream commit a362b0cc94d476b097ba0ff466958c1d4e27e219 ]

Commit 99e71c029213 ("arm64: dts: imx8mq-librem5: Don't mark buck3 as always on")
removed always-on marking from GPU regulator, which is great for power
saving - however it introduces additional i2c0 traffic which can be deadly
for devices from the Dogwood batch.

To workaround the i2c0 shutdown issue on Dogwood, this commit marks
buck3 as always-on again - but only for Dogwood (r3).
