Subject: [PATCH] tcp: only postpone PROBE_RTT if RTT is < current min_rtt
 estimate
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.11
Git-commit: 1b9e2a8c99a5c021041bfb2d512dc3ed92a94ffd

[ Upstream commit 1b9e2a8c99a5c021041bfb2d512dc3ed92a94ffd ]

During loss recovery, retransmitted packets are forced to use TCP
timestamps to calculate the RTT samples, which have a millisecond
granularity. BBR is designed using a microsecond granularity. As a
result, multiple RTT samples could be truncated to the same RTT value
during loss recovery. This is problematic, as BBR will not enter
PROBE_RTT if the RTT sample is <= the current min_rtt sample, meaning
that if there are persistent losses, PROBE_RTT will constantly be
pushed off and potentially never re-entered. This patch makes sure
that BBR enters PROBE_RTT by checking if RTT sample is < the current
min_rtt sample, rather than <=.

The Netflix transport/TCP team discovered this bug in the Linux TCP
BBR code during lab tests.
