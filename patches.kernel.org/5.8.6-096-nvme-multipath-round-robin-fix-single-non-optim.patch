Subject: [PATCH] nvme: multipath: round-robin: fix single non-optimized path
 case
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.6
Git-commit: 93eb0381e13d249a18ed4aae203291ff977e7ffb

[ Upstream commit 93eb0381e13d249a18ed4aae203291ff977e7ffb ]

If there's only one usable, non-optimized path, nvme_round_robin_path()
returns NULL, which is wrong. Fix it by falling back to "old", like in
the single optimized path case. Also, if the active path isn't changed,
there's no need to re-assign the pointer.

Fixes: 3f6e3246db0e ("nvme-multipath: fix logic for non-optimized paths")
