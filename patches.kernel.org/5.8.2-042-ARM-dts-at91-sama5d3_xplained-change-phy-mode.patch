Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: at91: sama5d3_xplained: change phy-mode
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.2
Git-commit: 7dbf4bbf1c320d82058878bd44805724d171e1e8

[ Upstream commit 7dbf4bbf1c320d82058878bd44805724d171e1e8 ]

Since commit bcf3440c6dd7 ("net: phy: micrel: add phy-mode support for the
KSZ9031 PHY"), networking is broken on sama5d3 xplained.

The device tree has phy-mode = "rgmii" and this worked before, because
KSZ9031 PHY started with default RGMII internal delays configuration (TX
off, RX on 1.2 ns) and MAC provided TX delay. After above commit, the
KSZ9031 PHY starts handling phy mode properly and disables RX delay, as
result networking is become broken.

Fix it by switching to phy-mode = "rgmii-rxid" to reflect previous
behavior.
