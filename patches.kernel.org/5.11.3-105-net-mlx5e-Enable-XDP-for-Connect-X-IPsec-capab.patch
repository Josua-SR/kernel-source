Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5e: Enable XDP for Connect-X IPsec capable devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: e33f9f5f2d3a5fa97728a43708f41da2d4faae65

[ Upstream commit e33f9f5f2d3a5fa97728a43708f41da2d4faae65 ]

This limitation was inherited by previous Innova (FPGA) IPsec
implementation, it uses its private set of RQ handlers which
does not support XDP, for Connect-X this is no longer true.

Fix by keeping this limitation only for Innova IPsec supporting devices,
as otherwise this limitation effectively wrongly blocks XDP for all
future Connect-X devices for all flows even if IPsec offload is not
used.

Fixes: 2d64663cd559 ("net/mlx5: IPsec: Add HW crypto offload support")
