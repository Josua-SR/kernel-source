Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: Improve code around unlisted freq check
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.3
Git-commit: 97148d0ae5303bcc18fcd1c9b968a9485292f32a

commit 97148d0ae5303bcc18fcd1c9b968a9485292f32a upstream.

The cpufreq core checks if the frequency programmed by the bootloaders
is not listed in the freq table and programs one from the table in such
a case. This is done only if the driver has set the
CPUFREQ_NEED_INITIAL_FREQ_CHECK flag.

Currently we print two separate messages, with almost the same content,
and do this with a pr_warn() which may be a bit too much as the driver
only asked us to check this as it expected this to be the case. Lower
down the severity of the print message by switching to pr_info() instead
and print a single message only.
