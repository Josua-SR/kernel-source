[ Upstream commit dea252fa41cd8ce332d148444e4799235a8a03ec ]

When running dtbs_check thermal_zone warn about the
temperature declared.

thermal-zones: cpu-thermal:trips:cpu-alert0:temperature:0:0: 850000 is greater than the maximum of 200000

It's indeed wrong the real value is 85°C and not 850°C.
