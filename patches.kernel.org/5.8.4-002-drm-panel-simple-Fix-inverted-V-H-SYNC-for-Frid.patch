Subject: [PATCH] drm/panel-simple: Fix inverted V/H SYNC for Frida
 FRD350H54004 panel
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.4
Git-commit: bad20a2dbfdfaf01560026909506b6ed69d65ba2

[ Upstream commit bad20a2dbfdfaf01560026909506b6ed69d65ba2 ]

The FRD350H54004 panel was marked as having active-high VSYNC and HSYNC
signals, which sorts-of worked, but resulted in the picture fading out
under certain circumstances.

Fix this issue by marking VSYNC and HSYNC signals active-low.

v2: Rebase on drm-misc-next
