Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: force to build vmlinux if CONFIG_MODVERSION=y
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 4b50c8c4eaf06a825d1c005c0b1b4a8307087b83

commit 4b50c8c4eaf06a825d1c005c0b1b4a8307087b83 upstream.

This code does not work as stated in the comment.

$(CONFIG_MODVERSIONS) is always empty because it is expanded before
include/config/auto.conf is included. Hence, 'make modules' with
CONFIG_MODVERSION=y cannot record the version CRCs.

This has been broken since 2003, commit ("kbuild: Enable modules to be
build using the "make dir/" syntax"). [1]
