Subject: [PATCH] kthread_worker: prevent queuing delayed work from timer_fn
 when it is being canceled
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.7
Git-commit: 6993d0fdbee0eb38bfac350aa016f65ad11ed3b1

commit 6993d0fdbee0eb38bfac350aa016f65ad11ed3b1 upstream.

There is a small race window when a delayed work is being canceled and
the work still might be queued from the timer_fn:

	CPU0						CPU1
kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync()
   __kthread_cancel_work_sync()
     __kthread_cancel_work()
        work->canceling++;
					      kthread_delayed_work_timer_fn()
						   kthread_insert_work();

BUG: kthread_insert_work() should not get called when work->canceling is
set.
