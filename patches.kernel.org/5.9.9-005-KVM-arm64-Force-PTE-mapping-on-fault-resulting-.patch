Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Force PTE mapping on fault resulting in a device
 mapping
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.9
Git-commit: 91a2c34b7d6fadc9c5d9433c620ea4c32ee7cae8

[ Upstream commit 91a2c34b7d6fadc9c5d9433c620ea4c32ee7cae8 ]

VFIO allows a device driver to resolve a fault by mapping a MMIO
range. This can be subsequently result in user_mem_abort() to
try and compute a huge mapping based on the MMIO pfn, which is
a sure recipe for things to go wrong.

Instead, force a PTE mapping when the pfn faulted in has a device
mapping.

Fixes: 6d674e28f642 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Properly handle faulting of device mappings")
