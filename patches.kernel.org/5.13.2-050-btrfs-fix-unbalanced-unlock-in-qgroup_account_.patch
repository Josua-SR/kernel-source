Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix unbalanced unlock in qgroup_account_snapshot()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 44365827cccc1441d4187509257e5276af133a49

commit 44365827cccc1441d4187509257e5276af133a49 upstream.

qgroup_account_snapshot() is trying to unlock the not taken
tree_log_mutex in a error path. Since ret != 0 in this case, we can
just return from here.

Fixes: 2a4d84c11a87 ("btrfs: move delayed ref flushing for qgroup into qgroup helper")
