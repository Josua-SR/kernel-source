Subject: [PATCH] ext4: stop overwrite the errcode in ext4_setup_super
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.6
Git-commit: 5adaccac46ea79008d7b75f47913f1a00f91d0ce

[ Upstream commit 5adaccac46ea79008d7b75f47913f1a00f91d0ce ]

Now the errcode from ext4_commit_super will overwrite EROFS exists in
ext4_setup_super. Actually, no need to call ext4_commit_super since we
will return EROFS. Fix it by goto done directly.
