Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: sharpsl: Fix the probe error path
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 0f44b3275b3798ccb97a2f51ac85871c30d6fbbc

commit 0f44b3275b3798ccb97a2f51ac85871c30d6fbbc upstream.

nand_release() is supposed be called after MTD device registration.
Here, only nand_scan() happened, so use nand_cleanup() instead.

There is no Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
in this driver predates by far the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
which makes this change possible. However, pointing this commit as the
culprit for backporting purposes makes sense.
