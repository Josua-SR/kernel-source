Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: at91: sama5d2: map securam as device
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 9b5dcc8d427e2bcb84c49eb03ffefe11e7537a55

[ Upstream commit 9b5dcc8d427e2bcb84c49eb03ffefe11e7537a55 ]

Due to strobe signal not being propagated from CPU to securam
the securam needs to be mapped as device or strongly ordered memory
to work properly. Otherwise, updating to one offset may affect
the adjacent locations in securam.
