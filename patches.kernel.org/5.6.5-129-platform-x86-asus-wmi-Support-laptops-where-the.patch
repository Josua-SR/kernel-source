Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: asus-wmi: Support laptops where the first
 battery is named BATT
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.5
Git-commit: 6b3586d45bba14f6912f37488090c37a3710e7b4

commit 6b3586d45bba14f6912f37488090c37a3710e7b4 upstream.

The WMI method to set the charge threshold does not provide a
way to specific a battery, so we assume it is the first/primary
battery (by checking if the name is BAT0).
On some newer ASUS laptops (Zenbook UM431DA) though, the
primary/first battery isn't named BAT0 but BATT, so we need
to support that case.
