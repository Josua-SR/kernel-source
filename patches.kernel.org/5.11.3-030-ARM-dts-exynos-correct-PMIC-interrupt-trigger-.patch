Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: exynos: correct PMIC interrupt trigger level on
 Monk
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 8528cda2b7c667e9cd173aef1a677c71b7d5a096

[ Upstream commit 8528cda2b7c667e9cd173aef1a677c71b7d5a096 ]

The Samsung PMIC datasheets describe the interrupt line as active low
with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  Without specifying the
interrupt type in Devicetree, kernel might apply some fixed
configuration, not necessarily working for this hardware.
