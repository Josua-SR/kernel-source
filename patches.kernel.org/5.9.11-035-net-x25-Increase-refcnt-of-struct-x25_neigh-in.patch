Subject: [PATCH] net: x25: Increase refcnt of "struct x25_neigh" in
 x25_rx_call_request
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.11
Git-commit: 4ee18c179e5e815fa5575e0d2db0c05795a804ee

[ Upstream commit 4ee18c179e5e815fa5575e0d2db0c05795a804ee ]

The x25_disconnect function in x25_subr.c would decrease the refcount of
"x25->neighbour" (struct x25_neigh) and reset this pointer to NULL.

However, the x25_rx_call_request function in af_x25.c, which is called
when we receive a connection request, does not increase the refcount when
it assigns the pointer.

Fix this issue by increasing the refcount of "struct x25_neigh" in
x25_rx_call_request.

This patch fixes frequent kernel crashes when using AF_X25 sockets.

Fixes: 4becb7ee5b3d ("net/x25: Fix x25_neigh refcnt leak when x25 disconnect")
