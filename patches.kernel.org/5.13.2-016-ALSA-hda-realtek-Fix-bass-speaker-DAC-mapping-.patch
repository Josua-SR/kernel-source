Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix bass speaker DAC mapping for Asus
 UM431D
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: f8fbcdfb0665de60997d9746809e1704ed782bbc

commit f8fbcdfb0665de60997d9746809e1704ed782bbc upstream.

Asus Zenbook 14 UM431D has two speaker pins and a headphone pin, and
the auto-parser ends up assigning the bass to the third DAC 0x06.
Although the tone comes out, it's inconvenient because this DAC has no
volume control unlike two other DACs.

For obtaining the volume control for the bass speaker, this patch
enforces the mapping to let both front and bass speaker pins sharing
the same DAC.  It's not ideal but a little bit of improvement.

Since we've already applied the same workaround for another ASUS
machine, we just need to hook the chain to the existing quirk.
