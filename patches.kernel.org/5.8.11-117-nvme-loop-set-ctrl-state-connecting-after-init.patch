Subject: [PATCH] nvme-loop: set ctrl state connecting after init
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.11
Git-commit: 64d452b3560b7a55277c8d9ef0a8635e62136580

commit 64d452b3560b7a55277c8d9ef0a8635e62136580 upstream.

When creating a loop controller (ctrl) in nvme_loop_create_ctrl() ->
nvme_init_ctrl() we set the ctrl state to NVME_CTRL_NEW.

Prior to [1] NVME_CTRL_NEW state was allowed in nvmf_check_ready() for
fabrics command type connect. Now, this fails in the following code path
for fabrics connect command when creating admin queue :-

nvme_loop_create_ctrl()
 nvme_loo_configure_admin_queue()
  nvmf_connect_admin_queue()
   __nvme_submit_sync_cmd()
    blk_execute_rq()
      nvme_loop_queue_rq()
	nvmf_check_ready()

# echo  "transport=loop,nqn=fs" > /dev/nvme-fabrics
[ 6047.741327] nvmet: adding nsid 1 to subsystem fs
[ 6048.756430] nvme nvme1: Connect command failed, error wo/DNR bit: 880

We need to set the ctrl state to NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING after :-
nvme_loop_create_ctrl()
 nvme_init_ctrl()
so that the above mentioned check for nvmf_check_ready() will return
true.

This patch sets the ctrl state to connecting after we init the ctrl in
nvme_loop_create_ctrl()
 nvme_init_ctrl() .
