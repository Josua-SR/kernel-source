Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 8958/1: rename missed uaccess .fixup section
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.11
Git-commit: f87b1c49bc675da30d8e1e8f4b60b800312c7b90

commit f87b1c49bc675da30d8e1e8f4b60b800312c7b90 upstream.

When the uaccess .fixup section was renamed to .text.fixup, one case was
missed. Under ld.bfd, the orphaned section was moved close to .text
(since they share the "ax" bits), so things would work normally on
uaccess faults. Under ld.lld, the orphaned section was placed outside
the .text section, making it unreachable.
