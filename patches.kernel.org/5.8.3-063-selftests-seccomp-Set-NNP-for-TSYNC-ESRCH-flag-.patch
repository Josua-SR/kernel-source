Subject: [PATCH] selftests/seccomp: Set NNP for TSYNC ESRCH flag test
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.3
Git-commit: e4d05028a07f505a08802a6d1b11674c149df2b3

commit e4d05028a07f505a08802a6d1b11674c149df2b3 upstream.

The TSYNC ESRCH flag test will fail for regular users because NNP was
not set yet. Add NNP setting.

Fixes: 51891498f2da ("seccomp: allow TSYNC and USER_NOTIF together")
