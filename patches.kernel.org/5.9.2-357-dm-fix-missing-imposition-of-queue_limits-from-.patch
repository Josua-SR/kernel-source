Subject: [PATCH] dm: fix missing imposition of queue_limits from dm_wq_work()
 thread
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: 0c2915b8c6db108b1dfb240391cc5a175f97f15b

[ Upstream commit 0c2915b8c6db108b1dfb240391cc5a175f97f15b ]

If a DM device was suspended when bios were issued to it, those bios
would be deferred using queue_io(). Once the DM device was resumed
dm_process_bio() could be called by dm_wq_work() for original bio that
still needs splitting. dm_process_bio()'s check for current->bio_list
(meaning call chain is within ->submit_bio) as a prerequisite for
calling blk_queue_split() for "abnormal IO" would result in
dm_process_bio() never imposing corresponding queue_limits
(e.g. discard_granularity, discard_max_bytes, etc).

Fix this by always having dm_wq_work() resubmit deferred bios using
submit_bio_noacct().

Side-effect is blk_queue_split() is always called for "abnormal IO" from
->submit_bio, be it from application thread or dm_wq_work() workqueue,
so proper bio splitting and depth-first bio submission is performed.
For sake of clarity, remove current->bio_list check before call to
blk_queue_split().

Also, remove dm_wq_work()'s use of dm_{get,put}_live_table() -- no
longer needed since IO will be reissued in terms of ->submit_bio.
And rename bio variable from 'c' to 'bio'.
