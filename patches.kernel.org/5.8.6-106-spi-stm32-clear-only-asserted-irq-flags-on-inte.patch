Subject: [PATCH] spi: stm32: clear only asserted irq flags on interrupt
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.6
Git-commit: ae1ba50f1e706dfd7ce402ac52c1f1f10becad68

[ Upstream commit ae1ba50f1e706dfd7ce402ac52c1f1f10becad68 ]

Previously the stm32h7 interrupt thread cleared all non-masked interrupts.
If an interrupt was to occur during the handling of another interrupt its
flag would be unset, resulting in a lost interrupt.
This patches fixes the issue by clearing only the currently set interrupt
flags.
