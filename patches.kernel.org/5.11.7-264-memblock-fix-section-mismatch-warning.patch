Subject: [PATCH] memblock: fix section mismatch warning
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.7
Git-commit: 34dc2efb39a231280fd6696a59bbe712bf3c5c4a

[ Upstream commit 34dc2efb39a231280fd6696a59bbe712bf3c5c4a ]

The inlining logic in clang-13 is rewritten to often not inline some
functions that were inlined by all earlier compilers.

In case of the memblock interfaces, this exposed a harmless bug of a
missing __init annotation:

WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text+0x507c0a): Section mismatch in reference from the function memblock_bottom_up() to the variable .meminit.data:memblock
The function memblock_bottom_up() references
the variable __meminitdata memblock.
This is often because memblock_bottom_up lacks a __meminitdata
annotation or the annotation of memblock is wrong.

Interestingly, these annotations were present originally, but got removed
with the explanation that the __init annotation prevents the function from
getting inlined.  I checked this again and found that while this is the
case with clang, gcc (version 7 through 10, did not test others) does
inline the functions regardless.

As the previous change was apparently intended to help the clang builds,
reverting it to help the newer clang versions seems appropriate as well.
gcc builds don't seem to care either way.
