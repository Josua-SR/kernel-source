Subject: [PATCH] regulator: da9063: fix LDO9 suspend and warning.
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.7
Git-commit: d7442ba13d62de9afc4e57344a676f9f4623dcaa

[ Upstream commit d7442ba13d62de9afc4e57344a676f9f4623dcaa ]

Commit 99f75ce66619 ("regulator: da9063: fix suspend") converted
the regulators to use a common (corrected) suspend bit setting but
one of regulators (LDO9) slipped through the crack.

This means that the original problem was not fixed for LDO9 and
also leads to a warning found by the test robot.
	da9063-regulator.c:515:3: warning: initialized field overwritten

Fix this by converting that regulator too like the others.
