Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: make sure jh have b_transaction set in
 refile/unfile_buffer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.6
Git-commit: 24dc9864914eb5813173cfa53313fcd02e4aea7d

[ Upstream commit 24dc9864914eb5813173cfa53313fcd02e4aea7d ]

Callers of __jbd2_journal_unfile_buffer() and
__jbd2_journal_refile_buffer() assume that the b_transaction is set. In
fact if it's not, we can end up with journal_head refcounting errors
leading to crash much later that might be very hard to track down. Add
asserts to make sure that is the case.

We also make sure that b_next_transaction is NULL in
__jbd2_journal_unfile_buffer() since the callers expect that as well and
we should not get into that stage in this state anyway, leading to
problems later on if we do.

Tested with fstests.
