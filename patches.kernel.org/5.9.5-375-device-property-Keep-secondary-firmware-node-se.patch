Subject: [PATCH] device property: Keep secondary firmware node secondary by
 type
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.5
Git-commit: d5dcce0c414fcbfe4c2037b66ac69ea5f9b3f75c

commit d5dcce0c414fcbfe4c2037b66ac69ea5f9b3f75c upstream.

Behind primary and secondary we understand the type of the nodes
which might define their ordering. However, if primary node gone,
we can't maintain the ordering by definition of the linked list.
Thus, by ordering secondary node becomes first in the list.
But in this case the meaning of it is still secondary (or auxiliary).
The type of the node is maintained by the secondary pointer in it:

	secondary pointer		Meaning
	NULL or valid			primary node
	ERR_PTR(-ENODEV)		secondary node

So, if by some reason we do the following sequence of calls

	set_primary_fwnode(dev, NULL);
	set_primary_fwnode(dev, primary);

we should preserve secondary node.

This concept is supported by the description of set_primary_fwnode()
along with implementation of set_secondary_fwnode(). Hence, fix
the commit c15e1bdda436 to follow this as well.
