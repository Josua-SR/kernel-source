commit d7787cc04e0a1f2043264d1550465081096bd065 upstream.

While I thought I had this correct (since it actually did reject modes
like I expected during testing), Ville Syrjala from Intel pointed out
that the logic here isn't correct. max_clock refers to the max data rate
supported by the DP encoder. So, limiting it to the output of ds_clock (which
refers to the maximum dotclock of the downstream DP device) doesn't make any
sense. Additionally, since we're using the connector's bpc as the canonical BPC
we should use this in mode_valid until we support dynamically setting the bpp
based on bandwidth constraints.

For more info.

So, let's rewrite this using Ville's advice.

v2:
* Ville pointed out I mixed up the dotclock and the link rate. So fix that...
* ...and also rename all the variables in this function to be more appropriately
  labeled so I stop mixing them up.
* Reuse the bpp from the connector for now until we have dynamic bpp selection.
* Use use DIV_ROUND_UP for calculating the mode rate like i915 does, which we
  should also have been doing from the start
