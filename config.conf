# Kernel configuration file selection.
# See the arch-symbols script for a list of symbols defined.
# -syms excludes a flavor from the kernel-syms package (vanilla is excluded
# automatically).

#
# IMPORTANT: the subdirectory names map to cpuarch
#            kernel-binary and kernel-source rely on this
#

# the build flavor is used in OBS and is not RT as the kvm usecase is somehow
# incompatible with RT
