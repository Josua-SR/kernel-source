Subject: x86: stackprotector: Avoid random pool on rt
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel.git
Git-commit: da77ceac3d20f27310a07a7c346a4ee6b40d6c28
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: SLE Realtime Extension

CPU bringup calls into the random pool to initialize the stack
canary. During boot that works nicely even on RT as the might sleep
checks are disabled. During CPU hotplug the might sleep checks
trigger. Making the locks in random raw is a major PITA, so avoid the
call on RT is the only sensible solution. This is basically the same
randomness which we get during boot where the random pool has no
entropy and we rely on the TSC randomnness.
